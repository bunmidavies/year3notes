- empirical = experimental, using an actual training set
- ==empirical risk refers to the error of a sample==

- the empirical risk minimizer is a sort of hypothetical idea where we search across all possible models we have, to find the minimum empirical risk i.e. given we have some training sample, we find the model which has the lowest training error

$$f_{erm} := \textrm{arginf}\hat{R}(f,S_n)$$
