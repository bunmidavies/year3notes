- we use $\Omega$ to represent ==all possible functions from X to Y== - depending on what ML 'implementation' we use, we will be able to cover different areas of this entire family
- we define a group of models we have access to as our ==model family== - which is a subset of all possible functions, and is denoted with $\mathcal{F}$
