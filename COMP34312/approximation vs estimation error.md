[[COMP34312]]

- ==approximation error== - the error between the the best possible model we can create in our family $f*$ (NOT the erm) and Bayes model, due to having a restricted model family
- ==estimation error== - the error between the [[empirical risk minimization|erm]] and Bayes model, due to having a small sample, where the empirical risk is a poor estimate of the population risk for that given model

- in short
	- optimisation error = faults in learning algorithm
	- estimation error = faults in the data
	- approximation error = faults in the model

- the [[excess risk]]
