- excess risk of a model $f$ can be defined simply as the difference between its population risk and the [[bayes model|bayes risk]], i.e.
$$R(f) - R(y*)$$


- therefore, the excess risk of the [[empirical risk + empirical risk minimizer (ERM)|empirical risk minimizer]] can be denoted as
$$R(f_{erm}) - R(y*)$$
