- Vernon in 'Artificial Cognitive Systems: A Primer' outlines 4 main aspects to consider when modelling artificial cognitive systems:
	1. how much inspiration we take from natural systems
	2. how faithful we try to be in copying the target system
	3. how important we think the system's physical structure is
	4. how we separate the identification of cognitive capability from the way we decide to actually implement it

- these 4 aspects allow us to identify cognitive systems/robots on a 2-axes graph, where one axis indicates how 'bioinspired' our model is (i.e. intelligent robotics = no biological inspiration), and the other indicates the level of abstraction from the target model
