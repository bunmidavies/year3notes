# sensorimotor stage
- ages: birth to 2 years
- the infant understand the world through the movements they make and the resulting sensations - basic actions like sucking, grasping and looking allow infants to learn
- within this time, ==object permanence== is learned, and infants learn to separate beings from the people and objects around them
- infants also realise that their actions cause things to happen in the world around them

# preoperational stage
- ages: 2 to 7 years
- at this point, symbolic thinking begins to be learned, and children use words/pictures to represent objects
- at this stage, children are typically quite egocentric and struggle to understand the perspectives of others
- children may still think 'concretely' about the world around them - e.g.

> For example, a researcher might take a lump of clay, divide it into two equal pieces, and then give a child the choice between two pieces of clay to play with. One piece of clay is rolled into a compact ball while the other is smashed into a flat pancake shape. Because the flat shape _looks_ larger, the preoperational child will likely choose that piece, even though the two pieces are exactly the same size.
# concrete operational stage
- ages: 7 to 11 years
- at this point, children still think 'concretely' but begin to think logically about events
- the previous egocentrism begins to disappear, and things such as conservation begin to be understood (i.e. children begin to understand the two clay pieces are equivalent from the prev example)
- children begin to use inductive logic, or reasoning from specific information to a general principle

# the formal operational stage
- ages: 12 years up
- at this stage, the adolescent/young adult begins to think abstractly and reason about hypothetical problems
- children begin to think more about moral, philosophical, ethical, social and political issues that require theoretical/abstract reasoning
