- developmental robotics is the interdisciplinary approach to the autonomous design of behavioural and cognitive capabilities in [[robots]], taking direct inspiration from the ==developmental principles== and mechanisms observed in natural cognitive systems

# principles

1. development as a dynamical system
   - dynamical systems are decentralised systems with self-organisation and emergence
   - *child development as the emergent product of the intricate and dynamic interaction of many decentralised and local interactions related to the child's growing body, brain and her environment*
   - your behaviour is determined by a combination of your cognitive state and environment, but isn't simply a linear sum (?)

2. phylogenetic (evolutionary) and ontogenetic (development) interaction
- ontogenesis = learning over the lifetime of an individual; maturation, learning and critical periods are all ontogenetic
- phylogenetic = learning over generations of individuals

3. embodied and situated development
- [[embodied intelligence]] - body-brain-environment interaction
- situatedness - learning in context

4. intrinsic motivation and social learning
- [[intrinsic motivation]] - curiousity, novelty-seeking, values and personal drives
- social learning + imitation - 

5. nonlinear, stage-like development
- [[piaget's stages of cognitive development]]
- U-Shape development - *"Temporary regressions imply that children can have a temporary relapse before a newly acquired ability consolidates"*

6. online open-ended cumulative learning
- linked to [[intrinsic motivation]]
- online learning - learning/training happens in the moment, as opposed to pre-training then testing
