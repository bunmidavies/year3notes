- morphological computation in nature is the idea of many human/animal body structures implicitly exploiting passive and compliant effectors - this exploitation of the body-environment interaction results in effective actuation
- morphological computation in robotics takes inspiration from these structures, in order to develop low energy consuming robots, with passive or hybrid passive-active actuators
- examples include:
