Embeddings are becoming increasingly useful in Natural Language Processing tasks, due to being able to convert vectors of a high dimension in to lower-dimensional vectors.

On the highest level, an embedding takes something represented as an array of some variable size, and turns it into an array of some fixed size, containing floating point numbers.

In addition to being able to reduce the dimensionality of vectors, embeddings can calculate weights such that similar words/vectors have similar embeddings, allowing various distance measures to be used.
