[[COMP34212]]

- actuators are mechanisms which enable effectors to execute movement - for humans/animals, these are muscles and tendons
- for robots, the 4 main types of actuators include:
	- [[electric motors]]
	- [[hydraulic]]
	- [[pneumatics]]
	- [[reactive materials]]
- any [[year2notes/archive/sem1/COMP24011/effectors|effector]] needs at least one actuator
- ==compliant actuators==: are software/hardware mechanisdms which respond to external force, by stopping its motor - these are safe for human-robot interaction

# active / passive actuation

- active actuators use energy to provide power to move the effector to a desired position
