- also known as Marr's levels of analysis, marr proposed that any complex information processing system can be analysed/modelled at 3 different levels

1. computational / theory - what is the ==phenomena== we're trying to represent?
2. algorithmic - how can such phenomena be represented as a ==process== with inputs and outputs?
3. implementation - how is the phenomena actually ==implemented==?
