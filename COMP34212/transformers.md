- transformers are deep neural networks that replace [[convolutional neural networks (CNN)|CNNs]] and RNNs with ==self-attention==

# visual transformers

- visual transformers take images and turn them into vector representations
- these input layers
- the transformer
- labels are outputted using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
