- behaviour-based robotics is the overall idea of robots employing reactive architectures, rather than preplanning all possible behaviours - this is a direct opposition to AI systems, which employ symbolic and representational methods
- Rodney Brooks is credited with most of the early behaviour-based robotics research, with early papers titled *"Planning is just a way to avoid figuring out what to do next"*, helping to popularise behaviour-based approaches - instead of using intermediate representations, and employing a direct sense-act cycle
- Brooks' work builds upon two robotics milestones - [[grey walters tortoise|Walter's Tortoises]] and [[braitenberg vehicles|Braitenberg's vehicles]]
