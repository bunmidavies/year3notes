*"The number of body parts forming the body of the robot, the relative position of these parts, the physical properties of each body part, and the characteristics of the joints among body parts can be encoded in the genotype and evolved together with the characteristics of the neural network of the robot. This is typically realized by using genotypes that encode growing rules, which determine how the initial “embryo” grows and differentiates, rather than using genotypes that directly encode the property of a fully formed robot."*

- genotype = only chromosomes i.e. the base encoding of some robot
- phenotype = expression of genotype - the robots presentation and resulting body/behaviour

# direct encoding (Miller, Todd & Hedge)

- robot characteristics e.g. a neural network can be directly encoded and thought of as the robot's ==genotype== 
- evolutionary algorithms involve evaluating robots with different genotypes (thus different morphologies), and the encodings of successful robots can be taken and mutated/adapted to form a new generation of robots, with the same steps previously taken being repeated 
# grammar encoding (kitano)

- Kitano's approach involved encoding weight values and neural network structure within the genotype of a robot

# evolving virtual creatures (sims)

*a research project involving simulated Darwinian evolutions of virtual block creatures. A population of several hundred creatures is created within a computer, and each creature is tested for their ability to perform a given task, such as the ability to swim in a simulated water environment, or locomote on a simulated land environment. Those creatures that are most successful at their task are selected for survival, and their virtual genes of coded growth instructions are copied, combined, and randomly mutated to make offspring for a new population. The new creatures are again tested, and some may be improvements on their parents. As this cycle of variation and selection continues, creatures with more and more successful behaviors can emerge. The creatures shown in this video are results from many independent simulations in which they were selected for swimming, walking, jumping, following, or competing for control of a green cube.*
