[[COMP34212]]

- LIDAR = Light Detection and Ranging, aka laser radar, ladar
- typically used for indoor navigation and mapping, as well as [[SLAM vs vSLAM vs VO|SLAM]] by emitting highly amplified and coherent radiation at a target frequency
- the sensor emits highly amplified and coherent radiation at a target frequency, with a planar 2D horizontal
- LIDARs are fast due to the time-of-flight principle, and phase-shift measurements are taken for short-range distances
