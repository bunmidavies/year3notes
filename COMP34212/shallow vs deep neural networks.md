- shallow/deep neural networks are the 2 main ways to describe different ==architectures/topologies== of artificial neural networks

- ==shallow== (classical) neural networks typically include:
	- simple perceptron (2 layers)
	- MLP - multi-layer perceptron (3 layers)

- ==deep== neural networks:
	- CNN - convolutional neural networks
	- RNN - recurrent neural networks (e.g. LSTM - not as many layers but functionality is different)
	- transformers
	- GAN
	- 'celebrities': AlexNet, GPT, VGG16, ResNet50, BERT
