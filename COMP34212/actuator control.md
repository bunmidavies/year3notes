- for any actuator, it is impossible to know the exact outcome of some action - uncertainty is always involved

# closed-loop control / feedback control

- feedback control is the process of achieving and maintaining some desired state by continuously comparing the current state with the desired state
- information is continually fed back using sensors, and the error is defined as the difference between the current state and the desired state
- [[types of feedback control]]

# open-loop control / feedforward control

- contrasting to feedback control, with feedforward control force is applied to joints with the aim of reaching a desired state, without receiving feedback relating to the difference between the current state and the desired state
- therefore, no error is involved, and no sensory feedback is involved
