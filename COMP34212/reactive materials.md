[[COMP34212]]

- reactive materials cover any materials producing small movement (shrinking/elongation) due to the reaction to light, or chemical substances or temperatue
- pros:
	- suitable for microrobots
	- actuation is linear (?)
- cons
	- only really suited to small robots/weak movement
- examples include:
	- photo-reactive matierals
	- chemically-reactive materials
	- thermally-reactive materials
