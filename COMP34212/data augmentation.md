- data augmentation is the idea of extending an existing training set by generating new examples, in order to reduce overfitting, thus improving the generalisation of a model

- for image classification, there are many common ways to augment existing examples:
	- add noise to the image
	- change lighting within the image
	- rotate/shift the image
	- randomly erasing parts of the image
	- altering intensities of RGB channels
