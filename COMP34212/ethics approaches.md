# deontological ethics

- deontological ethics follows the idea that certain actions are correct because they follow some moral/ethical prinicple, ignoring whether the product of the action is good or not
- any true, moral law is universally applicable, and the guiding value for decisions being made are whether they are "right", rather than whether they are good or not
- this can be applied to robot ethics by deciding what definitive rules there are to make what are defined as morally correct decisions, instead of assessing the potential outcomes of each moral decision
- in short: ==whether the action is right is more important than whether its consequences are right==

# utilitarianism (consequentialism)

- instead of having universal rules across all cultures, cultures apply some sort of "utilitarian calculus" to compare the sum of all individual utility over all people in society, given some rules
- utility = whether something is 'good'
- this contrasts to deontological ethics since instead of now picking the action that is deemed to be 'right' irrespective of the outcome, ==results now matter, rather than the action==
# virtue ethics

- users are left to decide their own ethics, a sort of *intuitive* ethics - advocated by Aristotle, focus is placed on the character of whoever is making the decision
- "Phronesis" - the ability to evaluate a given situation and respond fittingly, developed through both education and experience
- considered the dominant approach after utilitarianism - the main difference between the other 2 approaches is in that choices made are ==personal== -
