# deontological ethics

- Kant believed the responsibility of the individual to discover the true moral law for themself
- any true, moral law is universally applicable
- this can be applied to robot ethics by deciding what definitive rules there are

# utilitarianism (consequentialism)

- instead of having universal rules across all cultures, cultures apply some sort of "utilitarian calculus" to compare the sum of all individual utility over all people in society, given some rules
- utility = presentation of an individual agent's preference

# virtue ethics

- users are left to decide their own ethics, a sort of *intuitive* ethics
- "Phronesis" - the ability to evaluate a given situation and respond fittingly, developed through both education and experience
- considered the dominant approach after utilitarianism
