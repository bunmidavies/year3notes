# Abstract + Intro

- the aim of the paper was to perform a meta-analysis of published literature related to the use of social robots within education
- Social robots have been shown to be effective at increasing cognitive/affective outcomes, largely due to their physical presence, which traditional technologies lack
- three key research questions were aimed to be answered:
	- how effective are robot tutors at achieving learning outcomes?
	- what is the contribution made by the robot's appearance and behaviour
	- what are the potential roles of a robot in an educational setting?

# Benefits of social robots as tutoring agents

- Shrinking school budgets, growing number of students per classroom, and the demand of greater personalisation of curricula for children fuels technology-based support
- Compared with virtual agents, physical robots offer three advantages:
	- can be used for curricula/populations that require real-world engagement
	- users show more social behaviours that are beneficial for learning when engaging with physical robots
	- learning gains are increased when interacting with physical robots in comparison to virtual agents
- examples could include teaching handwriting, how to play sports, etc.
- physical robots can provide more enjoyable experiences in comparison to a virtual agent, and are often perceived more positively - additionally, physical robots yield more compliance to their requests in comparison to a virtual agents requests
- positive perceptions and task performance is increased with the presence of a physical robot

# Technical challenges

- fully autonomous social tutoring behaviour in an unconstrained environment is still a challenge for physical robots - perceiving the social world (cues, responses, attention, speech) must be robust
- choosing the correct emotional support strategy with appropriate gestures can positively affect student recall and learning, but simultaneously, more social behaviour can be distracting, so behaviour must be designed carefully
- personalising interactions to a specific user in both tutoring style and more straightforward styles (e.g. addressing student by name, referencing personal details) can also show increased learning gains, but remains an open challenge

# Review

- studies that were analysed were split into two categories in terms of their outcomes:
	- cognitive outcomes: learning gains, knowledge, comprehension, application (typically tested by tests of student knowledge)
	- affective outcomes: attentiveness, reception of robot, responsiveness, inquisitiveness (often measured with self-reports/experimenter observations)
- most studies are focused on children, with typically one learner involved, and nearly half of the studies using Nao
- positive cognitive outcomes did not imply positive affective outcomes and vice versa - many studies also do not consider learning in comparison with an alternative tutoring method, but with other versions of the same robot
- dominance of Nao within HRI can be attributed to wide availability, appealing appearance, accessible price point, technical robustness, ease of programming
- Keepon robot is also a popular tutor robot, with similar medium sized effect to cognitive learning gain
- it is not implied that the social appearance of a robot is required for effective tutoring, but it is suggested so - for instance, shorter robots are often preferred when teaching young children
- robots that personalise are shown to increase cognitive learning gains - more complex behaviours e.g. attention guiding, congruent gaze behaviour, nonverable immediacy, and empathy may all be able to aid in both cognitive and affective outcomes
- physical presence may be having a positive impact on compliance, engagement and conformity, which ultimately help with learning gains (thus making physical presence an indirect cause of positive cognitive/affective effects)
- robots also don't have to be teachers/tutors - they can act as novices (so students become instructors) or aid learning through a peer-to-peer relationship (e.g. Robovie as a peer for teaching english to japanese children showed better results in comparison to an identical Robovie acting as a tutor)

# Discussion

- robots firstly need a sufficient interpretation of a social environment in order to respond appropriately, and correctly receive input - this requires significant progress in fields including speech recognition and visual social signal processing
- utterances within young children is one of the main hurdles causing speech recognition to still be inadequate - touch screens can alleviate this, but constrain the natural flow of interactions
- robots need to understand a learners ability sufficiently in order to make the correct actions
- generating verbal and nonverbal output remains a challenge, with timing of output being one of the main hurdles
- ==in short: social interaction requires the artificial equivalent of various cognitive mechanisms==
- there can also be downsides of students using robots too much, or not asking for enough help
- the main hope for robots is the ability to personalise learning experiences, and provide support in the current resource-constrained environment. This ultimately allows human teachers to focus on what they do best
- overall, the cognitive effect sizes of robots is almost matching with those of human tutoring, for restricted topics e.g. maths or handwriting - the same technical and logistical challenges exist, but once robots can improve their physical embodiment as well as abilities within a social environment, robots are likely to become much more effective than any competing learning technologies
