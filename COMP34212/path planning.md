- path planning can take 2 main approaches:
	- ==qualitative== (topological/route navigation)
		- agent's perspective
		- topological route with distinct landmarks/associations - landmarks can be thought of as waypoints which are easy for the robot to recognise, e.g. natural landmark, sign, visual pattern, or landmark to change behaviour
		- the world can be thought of as a relational graph of nodes and edges - the nodes always represent gateways/landmarks/goals, while the edges represent the paths to get to the path
