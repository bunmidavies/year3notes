# 1943 - Neuron modelling

- in the 1940s, McCulloch and Pitt developed the mathematical model of the functioning of a single neuron in the brain, with the belief that "The average neuron has several thousand inputs"

# 1957 - Perceptron

- the perceptron was the direct hardware implementation of McCulloch and Pitts neuron, built at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Frank Rosenblatt

# 1960 - ADALINE

- ADALINE = Adaptive Linear Neuron initially, then Adaptive Linear Element, was a physical device that implemented a single-layer neural network
- ADALINE differed to the single-layered perceptron due to ADALINE involving a teacher signal, such that the weights are adjusted to match this teacher signal - the single-layer perceptron simply adjusts unit weights to match the correct output

# 1969 - XOR problem

- it became apparent that a single-layer perceptron cannot solve any linearly nonseparable vectors - i.e. classification could not be performed if a straight line couldn't be used to separate the two classes
- what followed past this point was the "AI winter" or dark age, since simple boolean functions such as XOR were unable to be correctly learned by current technology

# 1986 - Multi-Layer Perceptron + Backpropagation

- in 1982, the first paper detailing backpropagation was published, and backpropagation had been applied to MLPs, but not with a huge amount of research to document such applications 
- by 1986, Ravid E. Rumelhart et al. published an analysis of backpropagation, helping with the popularisation of backpropagation, and the research into multilayer perceptrons

# 1995 - SVM

- Support Vector Machines i.e. SVMs were developed at AT&T bell labs, and introduced the ability to efficiently perform non-linear classification using the kernel trick (i.e. implicitly mapping inputs to higher-dimensional feature spaces)
# 1998 - LeNet

- LeNet-5 is a simple convolutional neural network (and often referred to as the ==first convolutional network==, often referred to as LeNet, proposed by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998
- as the original promoter of deep learning, the original form of LeNet was proposed in 1989 when LeCun applied the backpropagation algorithm to practical applications at Bell Labs
