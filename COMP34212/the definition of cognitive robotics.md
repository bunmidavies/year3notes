- mainly covered within chapter 1 of [[Cognitive-Robotics-Cangesoli.pdf|Cangesoli - Cognitive Robotics]], Cognitive Robotics, shortened to CR, has a strong emphasis on being an interdisciplinary approach
- CR in its early days had a number of experts who came from the AI knowledge representation field, so naturally this has seeped into the definition - but still, one can only propose a definition rather than have one 'set in stone'

> Cognitive Robotics is the field that combines insights and methods from AI, as well as cognitive and biological sciences, to robotics

- CR differs from intelligent robotics/'AI Robotics' - i.e. a pure combo of AI and robotics - due to CR's emphasis on designing ==bioinspired/cognitively inspired== robots
- the two fields essentially create a spectrum between one another, where some robots can be created completely based off biological mechanisms (Mori/Kuniyoshi's realistic rendering of the human fetus), some can be created completely based off AI techniques without any need for biological inspiration, and some can use both

- CR is closely linked to the idea of ==cognitive systems==, i.e. machines/software with humanlike cognition, which is “capacity for self-reliance, for being able to figure things out, for in de pen dent adaptive anticipatory action” (Vernon 2014, 2)
