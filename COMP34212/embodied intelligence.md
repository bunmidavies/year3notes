[What's that Thing Called Embodiment?](https://escholarship.org/content/qt60w6v9jz/qt60w6v9jz.pdf)

- the concept of embodiment has existed since around the 1980s, used extensively in cognitive and AI literature
- the broadest notion of embodiment is the idea that a system is embodied if it is structurally coupled to its environment:

*"A system X is embodied in an environment E if for every time t at which both X and E exist, some subset of E's possible states with respect to X have the capacity to perturb X's state, and some subset of X's possible states with respect to E have the capacity to perturb E's state*

- definitions can very much vary though, others including

*"A system is embodied if it has gained competence within the environment in which it has developed"*

- sensorimotor embodiment may be defined as a system being connected to its environment through their own [[sensors]] and [[actuators]]

- embodied cognition typically has two approaches within research: radical embodied cognition (which doesn't believe in representational views of embodied cognition - eliminativism), and mainstream embodied cognitive science (the more popular approach, involving representational views)

- how embodiment affects cognition is also a wide area of research - based on interactions with an environment, different cognitive capacities may be affected

- within [[Cognitive-Robotics-Cangesoli.pdf]], there can be thought to be 4 different bodies from which 'embodiment' may concern:
	- the social body, as it appears to other
	- the sensorimotor body, which interacts with the environment
	- the living body, which has its right to self-regulate and self-maintain
	- the lived body, as it is experienced by an agent itself
