- [choregraphe](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/software/choregraphe/tutos/index.html) is one of the easiest ways of programming the [[softbank PEPPER robot]] - no code is involved, only graphical blocks are combined in order to form behaviours
- this makes the platform useful for:
	- learning robot programming
	- developing simple behaviours
	- simulation
	- monitoring the robot
	- designing animations
