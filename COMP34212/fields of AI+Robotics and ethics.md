# AI ethics

- ethics for AI/robotics; responsible AI
- how we decide what is ethical when we deploy robotics systems into society

*AI ethics is a set of values, principles, and techniques that employ widely accepted standard of right and wrong to guide moral conduct in the development and use of AI technologies* (Leslie 2019)

# Machine Ethics

- are robots able to develop their own ethics independent of human intervention?
- robots may be trained to read certain documents explaining various ethical principles/frameworks, then it is left for the robot to decide their own morals/ethics

*"An ethical machine is guided by own, intrinsic ethical rule, or set of rules, in deciding how to act in a given situation"*

- moor's "The nature, importance, and difficulty of machine ethics":
	1. ethical impact agents: any machine that can be evaluated for its ethical consequences
	2. implicit ethical agents: machines that are designed to avoid unethical outcomes
	3. explicit ethical agents: machines that can reason about ethics
	4. full ethical agents: machines that can make explicit moral judgements and justify them - thus have some knowledge/intuition to decide what they think is right
