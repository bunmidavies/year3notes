[[COMP34212]]

- covered extensively within Chapter 1.3 of [[Cognitive-Robotics-Cangesoli.pdf|Cangesoli - CR]], the history of CR can be thought of as being divided into 3 main periods:
	- (50s-80s) - Prehistory: earliest attempts of modelling humanlike robots - roots of CR but also general robotics/AI lie here
	- (90s) - Establishment: an actual concept of CR is conceived
	- (00s+) - Contemporary Evolution
- note that before the 50s there is a brief 'pure robotics' period
