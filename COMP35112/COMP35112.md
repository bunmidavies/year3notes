> - intro live lecture: logistics, why multiprocessors? transistor count timeline - ==architectural approaches to increasing single processor clock speed have been exhausted==, moores law (mostly due to transistor size reduction)
> - [[dennard scaling]] - single core performance hits wall, resort to multicore, resulting in parallelism to be exploited
> - the world of parallelism
