[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling)

- based on a 1974 paper co-authored by Robert Dennard
- ==as transistors get smaller, power density remains constant, less power is consumed==
- this allowed manufacturers to drastically increase clock frequencies from one generation to the next, giving programmers a free lunch (if the software they wrote was slow, they could just wait for the next generation of CPUs for performance to improve)

- by around 2006, dennard scaling appeared to break down
	- as transistors get smaller, current leakage increases, and heat dissipation within the chip becomes a problem - frequencies on singular processors cannot be increased like before

- the breakdown of dennard scaling resulted in manufacturers to shift focus from clock frequency to multicore processors
