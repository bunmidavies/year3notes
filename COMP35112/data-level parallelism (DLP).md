- data-level parallelism (DLP) refers to parallelism which exists due to structured data, allowing the same/very similar computation to be applied on multiple elements of said structured data
- examples include:
	- matrix multiplication, fourier transform
	- anti-aliasing, texture mapping, illumination/shading
	- differential equations: weather forecasting, simulation, financial modelling
