[[COMP35112]]

- the concerns pertaining to chip multiprocessors can be divided into 2 categories
# hardware
- interconnection between cores and how the cores are connected to memory
- what parallel programming patterns should be reflected (e.g. [[data-level parallelism (DLP)]])
- should many, simple cores be used, or few, complex cores be used?
- should cores be generalised or special purpose (i.e. GPUs)

# software
- should conventional languages be extended to handle multiple cores
- instead, should new domain specific languages be introduced instead?
