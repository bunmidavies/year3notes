- ==sensors== are physical devices to measure physical quantities, a common piece of hardware within [[robots]]
- sensors can measure two types of physical quantities:
	- internal (proprioception): the robot's own battery and motor forces
	- external (exteroception): vision, distance, tactile, olphactory, geospatial

- the state space of a sensor describes all possible values or variations of a sensor, whether discrete or continuous
- meanwhile, the uncertainty of a sensor measures the robots inability to be certain about the state of itself and its environment - this can include noise and errors within sensors, as well as hidden states and a lack of prior knowledge about the environment the robot is in

- the levels of sensory processing can be split into 3 levels:
	- low: electronics
	- medium: signal processing (microphones, sonar)
	- high: computation (vision, NLP) and the fusion of sensors
#### passive sensors
examples include ==cameras==, which simply capture signals generated by other sources of the environment

#### active sensors
sensors which send energy into the environment, and rely on this energy being ==reflected== back to the sensor

#### range finders
sensors which find the distance to nearby objects, e.g. ==sonar sensors==

#### scanning lidars
==light detection and ranging== - uses laser beams and 1-pixel cameras, to provide longer ranges with better performance

#### tactile sensors
examples include whiskers, bump panels, touch-sensitive skin. Tactile sensors also measure ==range==, based on physical contact, designed for ranges very close to the robot

#### location sensors
the ==GPS== is the most common solution to localization problems, but can only be used outdoors

#### proprioceptive sensors
sensors which inform the robot of its own ==motion and internal config== - examples include ==shaft decoders== which count the revolution of motors of the robot

#### inertial sensors
examples include ==gyroscopes== - inertial sensors rely on the resistance of mass to the change of velocity

#### force sensors / torque sensors
==force sensors== are used to sense how hard a robot arm may be gripping an object, while a ==torque sensor== is used to sense how hard it is turning an object. These measurements are collected several hundreds of times per second, in order for a robot to quickly detect unexpected forces and correct its movement
