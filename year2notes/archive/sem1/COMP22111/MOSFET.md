MOSFETs are used within the vast majority of [[VLSI systems]] - MOSFET stands for ==Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor==

this name comes from earlier designs where layers of metal and semiconducting material was separated by an 'oxide' layer

==MOS== refers to any type of transistor with a metal-oxide layer, whereas ==MOSFET== specifically refers to the transistors with a metal-oxide layer to control the flow of current through the transistor

- the channel is made of a p-type material, and is also called the substrate
- the gate of a MOSFET sits between above the channel, between the source and drain - as can also be seen, the drain and source are of the same material
- the main dimensions to consider are both the length of the channel and its width (L and W), as well as the thickness of the source/drain

>[!note] Enhancement Mode Devices
> the MOSFETs we are concerned with in 32211 are ==enhancement== mode devices, meaning they are normally switched off, and require a voltage being applied in order to conduct charge
