- genetic drift - if only one individual within a population carries some variant, it is likely that the variation could be lost within the next generation (that individual gets preyed etc.)
- in short:
	1. human-caused events and natural events lead to a reduced or small population size
	2. due to a smaller population size, 3 common effects are often witnessed, including inbreeding depression, genetic drift and demographic stochasticity
	3. these 3 common effects all have the main resulting impact of a loss of genetic diversity
	4. the loss of genetic diversity leads to a reduction in individual fitness and population adaptability, which causes both lower reproduction and higher mortality
	5. lower reproduction and higher mortality ultimately results in a reduced or smaller population size - this leads us back to step 2
