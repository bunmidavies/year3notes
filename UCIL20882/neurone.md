- the neurone is the basic unit of the nervous system

- where the axon ends is known as the ==axon terminal==, and a myelinated axon involves the axon being wrapped in a non-continuous ==myelin sheath==
- the gaps between these sheaths are known as ==nodes of ranvier==

# plasma membrane

- this membrane is selectively permeable, containing multiple channels of different materials
- the resting membrane potential is where the inside of the resting cell has a negative charge (-70mV) - this is due to all the sodium channels being closed, such that all the positive charge carrying sodium ions are outside the cell
- when the cell is stimulated, all the sodium channels open while all the potassium channels close -
