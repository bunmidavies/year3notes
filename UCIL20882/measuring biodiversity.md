[[UCIL20882]]

- abundance: how much there is of any one type of species i.e. the quantity
- richness/variation: the total number of different species over space and time
- evenness: compares the similarity of population size (abundance) of each species present
# Simpson's Index

$$D = \frac{\sum n(n-1)}{N(N - 1)}$$
$$\textrm{Simpson's Index} = 1 - D$$

- $n$ = total number of organisms of a particular species
- $N$ = total number of organisms of all species
- the greater the value, the greater the sample diversity

# Sorensen's Coefficient of Similarity

$$C_s = \frac{2j}{(a+b)} \times 100$$
- $j$ = number of species joint in both communities
- $a$ = number of species in community $a$
- $b$ = number of species in community $b$
