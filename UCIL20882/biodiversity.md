- biodiversity can be formally defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources including inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of [[ecosystem|ecosystems]]
- there can be considered to be three levels of biodiversity:

# genetic diversity

- **genetic diversity** - the diversity of [[genes]] and [[allele|alleles]] within a population of a single species, as well as the pattern of heritable variation found within different populations of the same species - i.e. genetic diversity is the ==raw material of evolution==, measured using DNA-based techniques
- genetic variation within one species can reach so far of a point that a new species is formed, that isn't able to sexually reproduce with the original species - these species will often still look similar
- example: *Heliconius melpomene*

- the heliconius butterflies have also developed [[mullerian mimicry]]
# species diversity

- **species diversity** - the variety and abundance of different types of organisms which inhabit an area
- there are two main components to species diversity:
	- ==species richness==: the number of different species within an area
	- ==species evenness==: the relative abundance with which each species is represented in an area
# ecosystem diversity

- **ecosystem diversity** - the variety of habitats that occur within a region i.e. the mosaic of patches found within a landscape - by there being different habitats, the idea is that this implies a wider range of species will have a suitable place to live within the region of concern
- ecosystems can cover large areas e.g. a whole forest, or smaller areas, like a beach
