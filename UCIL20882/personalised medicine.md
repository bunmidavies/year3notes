- personalised medicine can be described as an approach to both preventative care and drug therapy, that is based on the individual's genetics & other relevant information
- personalised medicine is what [[precision medicine]] used to be called - although they can be used interchangeably today, there are some slightly subtleties between the two fields:
	- personalised medicine might be considered more holistic, not only taking into account the individual but other outside factors
	- unlike precision medicine, personalised medicine is not ==for one specific person==
