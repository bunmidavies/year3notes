[[UCIL20882]]

- clozapine is one of the most effective antipsychotics, but can cause [[agranulocytosis]] (causes low levels of white blood cells, making human extremely prone to illness), and requires weekly blood monitoring when administered
- the effects of clozapine are thought to be associated with variants in the HLA complex (part of the immune system), and 10 genes are identified in order to give:
	- a drug metabolism profile
	- blood clotting factors
	- metabolic genes
	- blood clotting genes
	- p-glycoprotein
	- HLA variants

# phyziotype

- a system used to detect antipsychotic drug-induced metabolic changes including:
	- weight gain
	- hyperlipidemia (basically too much cholestorol)
	- diabetic risks

- it also identifies [[single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)|SNPs]] in genes associated with:
	- antipsychotic pharamcology
	- appetite control
	- energy regulation
	- endocrinology
	- cholesterol homeostasis
- the human signature is used with biomathematical algorithms to determine a risk profile
