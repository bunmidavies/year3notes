- most traits and diseases, as already discussed, are multifactorial ([[multifactorial traits]])
- this means, finding any genetic risk factors associated with some trait/disease is difficult

- genome wide association studies (GWAS) aims to identify the common genetic variants (SNPs) between people with complex diseases and traits
- GWAS is performed by testing a minimum of hundreds of thousands of SNPs in a large population

- by finding particular landmark SNPs which are seen in greater proportions in affected individuals compared to unaffected individuals, we say these SNPs are ==associated== with the disease
- this association is more of a predisposition, since it's very rare for some SNP to have 100% association with a particular disease
- for this reason, having an SNP associated with a complex disease doesn't mean you'll develop that disease, but you may have a higher risk

- almost vice versa, some SNPs can help to establish the risk of environmental factors
- additionally, how patients' genomes affect response to certain medical treatments can be investigated with GWAS (==pharmacogenomics==)

- in 2005, less than 20 SNPs were known to be significantly associated to diseases
- through GWAS, by 2015, over 14,000 SNPs were known to be significantly associated to over 1500 traits and put into a public catalog
