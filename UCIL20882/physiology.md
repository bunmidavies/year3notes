- physiology is often described as ==the science of life== - mainly concerned with understanding the ==mechanisms== of living things on essentially any scale
- research in physiology allows us to understand the basis of cell function, up to the integrated behaviour of the entire human body and how its external environment influences it
- physiology typically acts as an interface between the physical sciences and life sciences - physiologists can work in research laboratories, hospitals, with elite athletes, and in many other fields
