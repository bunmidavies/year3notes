[[UCIL20882]]

- within DNA, there is a promoter which proteins bind onto in order to induce transcription of the following DNA into RNA molecules  
  
- Exons and Introns exist within the sequence of the gene - when RNA matures, only the exon sequence is kept, and the introns are spliced out  
  
- proteins also come and bind to the enhancer part of the DNA, in order to regulate transcription - this is essentially a **lock and key mechanism** - if mutation occurs within the enhancer, it is possible that certain proteins that previously regulated the transcription of this gene can no longer bind (thus the lock and key mechanism has broken), but additionally _other proteins that previously couldnt bind now have the ability to control this genes regulation_  
  
- whether mutations occur in exons or elsewhere in the dna sequence will ultimately change the resulting effects of the mutation
