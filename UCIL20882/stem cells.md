[[UCIL20882]]

- stem cells are characterised by having 2 behaviours:
	1. proliferation - i.e. can self-replicate
	2. specialisation - the ability to differentiate into a variety of specialised cell types after receiving certain signals
- the specialisation signals:
	- come from neighbouring cells
	- are encoded by developmental genes
	- lead to changes in gene expression
- when a stem cell specialises it also self renews i.e. another unspecialised stem cell is made

- there are a number of stem cells in humans:
	- [[embryonic stem cells (ESCs)]]
	- [[adult stem cells (ASCs)]]
	- [[neonatal stem cells]]

# uses

- replacement (as for [[tissue engineering]])
	- stem cells transformed outside the body into a wanted cell type and transplanted
	- SCs transplanted with chemicals/molecules and differentiation takes place within the body
- repair:
	- SCs transplanted and secrete modules that promote repair (usually MSCs)
	- for monogenetic disease: SCs modified genetically outside the body and re-implanted
- reuse:
