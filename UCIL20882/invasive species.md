[[UCIL20882]]

- invasive species are ==alien== species that spread after introduction and ==cause harm== to their environment - their spread/cause of harm is the typical factor that distinguishes them from any non-native species that has been introduced somewhere

# how invasives cause harm

- ==disease vectors and competitors==:
	- grey squirrels compete against red squirrels in the uk, while transmitting the squirrelpox virus
	- harlequin ladybugs predate natives and transmit microsporidian parasites
	- signal crayfish predate natives and transmit crayfish plague
- ==aggressive predators==:
	- the american mink which escaped from fur farms caused a 95% decline of water voles in the UK
	- killer shrimp preys on aquatic invertebrates and larvae, fish and their eggs
	- feral cats are responsible for extinctions of most mammals and several bird species in Australia
- ==economic damage==:
	- floating pennyworth: rapid growth, smothers natives, oxygen depletion all contribute to decreased fishing and recreation
	- rabbits in the uk burrowing and grazing, damages trees and changes ecosystems - £170m crop losses annually
	- japanese knotweed: eradication legally required - cost £250m annually in ecological and structural damage

# growth of invasives

- the speed at which alien species are establishing themselves is globally accelerating, driven by:
	- increased movement of goods and people around the world
	- land degradation
	- increasing trade in exotic pets and house plants
	- climate change - certain species which may have not been able to survive in certain climate due to conditions like temperature, are now able to survive

# invasion biology theory

- why non-native species become invasive may depend on a number of reasons, but there are a lot of points for species to fail to become invasive let alone non-native
	1. transport - relatively easy, since people and goods travel around the world
	2. the species must survive the transport
	3. surviving competition and antagonism; finding food
	4. spreading
	5. impact on local ecosystems (to be invasive is to be harmful)

- Enders et al. (2020) "conceptual map of invasion biology" establishes 5 concept clusters (related ideas that explain a species invasiveness)

### trait cluster
- some species are better invaders because of:
	- short generation times
	- many offspring
	- better adaptibility
	- "novel weapons"

### darwin's cluster
- some species are better invaders because:
	- the new environment is more susceptible (e.g. islands)
	- their relation to established species provides some advantage
	- theres an ecological "niche" when they arrive

### biotic interaction cluster
- some species are better invaders because:
	- they escape parasites, pathogens and predators that don't exist in their new environment
	- plants can allocate more carbon to growth than defence

### propagule cluster
- some species are better invaders because:
	- humans introduced them in large numbers
	- previously introduced aliens "pave the way"

### resource availability cluster
- some species are better invaders because:
	- the environment is initially richer in resources, and away from disturbance

# dealing with invasives

- trapping and killing
- applying pesticides (balsam bashing, herbicide application)
- biological control with natural enemies (e.g. introducing sap-sucking psyllids to deal with japanese knotweed, but they don't survive UK climate well)
