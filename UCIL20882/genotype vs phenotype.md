[[UCIL20882]]

# phenotype

- a trait (phenotype) is controlled by one or more proteins, but sometimes additionally the environment
- the environment can influence an individual's physiology, (through lifestyle) switch genes on/off, and on a grander scale shape natural selection

- example: siamese cats only have melanin in their cool extremities, because they have aa allele which produces a version of tyrosinase which is unstable when the temperature is higher - essentially, a temperature sensitive allele
- note that the arctic fox has the opposite allele

> Tyrosinase = enzyme which controls the production of melanin
