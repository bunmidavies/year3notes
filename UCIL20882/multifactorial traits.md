[[UCIL20882]]

- most [[genotype vs phenotype|phenotypes]] are due to several genes (i.e. combination of several alleles) + the environment - for instance, skin colour, height, weight, intelligence, behaviour
- these phenotypes are on a continuum, and can be considered to be ==multifactorial== - different traits will depend on a different number of genes and the environment with different weightings
