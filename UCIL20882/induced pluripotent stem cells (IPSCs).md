[[UCIL20882]]

- IPSCs essentially involve reprogramming somatic cells - a [[somatic cells|somatic cell]] (e.g. skin cells, cells other than [[germ cells]]) is genetically engineering with 4 genes and goes abck in development, presumably resetting the gene expression profile to the one of the embryonic stem cells
- many IPSCs can be made from somatic cells

- IPSCs can be extremely useful for modelling diseases
