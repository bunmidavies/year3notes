- IPSCs essentially involve reprogramming somatic cells - a somatic cell (e.g. skin cell) is genetically engineering with 4 genes and goes abck in development, presumably resetting the gene expression profile to the one of the embryonic stem cells
- many IPSCs can be made from somatic cells

- IPSCs can be extremely useful for modelling diseases
