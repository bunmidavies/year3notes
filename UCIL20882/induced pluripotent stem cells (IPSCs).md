- IPSCs essentially involve reprogramming somatic cells - a somatic cell (e.g. skin cell) is genetically engineering with 4 genes and goes back in development, presumably resetting the gene expression profile to an ==embryonic-like stem cell== ([[embryonic stem cells (ESCs)]])

- IPSCs can be made from many different somatic cells (fibroblasts don't have to be used)

- IPSCs can be extremely useful for modelling, but have a range of applications

# example - modelling parkinson's with IPSCs

- 'disease in a dish' approach allows you to just test a cell with the associated disease and figure out how you may be able to protect it from the disease
