[[UCIL20882]]

- methicillin resistant genes are often quite commonly found in different bacteria, thus can be passed around fairly often resulting in the 'notoriety' of MRSA
- *Staphylococcus aureus* carries symptoms such as:
	- skin & throat commensal
	- boils & carbuncles 
- the first report of MRSA was in 1961, and at its peak saw 7000 new cases per year - now, the approximated new cases per year is around 700
