[[UCIL20882]]

- one of the main takeaways is that patches with higher genetic variability should be conserved, and are typically prioritised for in-situ conservation
- a number of additional practices are also common:
	- restoring already damaged areas
	- debt-for-nature swaps
	- ecosystem valuation
	- captive breeding programs
	- re-introductions
	- reducing our footprint

# example: slipper orchid (Costa Rica)

- to preserve the endangered slipper orchid in costa rica, the first task was to map the genetic diversity of the orchid across costa rica, to then select areas to prioritise
- ex-situ conservation could then be prepared for by preserving germplasm tissue and seeds
