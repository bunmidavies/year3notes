- wiki definition: *"A microorganism or microbe is an organism of microscopic size, which may exist in its single-celled form or as a colony of cells"*
# viruses
- in the nanometer range, only visible with an electron microscope
- viruses technically do not follow the definition of a regular organism, since they are not living on their own
- mainly made out of DNA or RNA, and break down very easily - in essence, they are genetic elements (==subcellular parasites==) that replicate inside cells
- viruses are classified by the type of nucleic acid/how it replicates/whether its single or double stranded

# bacteria
- bacteria - ($\micro$m or $10^{-6}$ range) - single-celled [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] microorganisms
- no membrane bound nucleus
