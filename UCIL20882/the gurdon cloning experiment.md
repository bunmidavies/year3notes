reading:

- the Gurdon cloning experiment revealed to us things about a cell's developmental potential (i.e. its ==potency==)
- as a cell becomes more specialised, its potency decreases - this means, there are fewer cells it can differentiate into

- Gurdon's experiment involved the following
	1. take 2 frog egg cells, and remove the nucleus (resulting in an ==enucleated egg cell==)
	2. in one egg cell, transplant a nucleus from a less differentiated cell in a frog embryo, and in the other egg cell transplant a nucleus from a fully differentiated intestinal cell
	3. activate both egg cells in order to begin development
- what was observed is that the egg cell with the less differentiated nucleus most commonly developed into a tadpole, while the cell with the fully differentiated nucleus stopped developing before the tadpole stage
- this proved the point made early, that as a cell becomes more specialised, its potency decreases
