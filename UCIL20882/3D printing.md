[[UCIL20882]]

- a common application of 3D printing is the 3D printing of pills - this allows polypills to be formed, and to change the dose according to the patient (i.e. including their age, weight, organ function)
- organs and tissues can also be 3d printed ([[tissue engineering]])

- advantages include:
	- high adaptability
	- on-demandness
	- fast prototyping
	- cost effective
	- complex and more intricate designs are possible
	- highly scalable
- disadvantages include:
	- whether the plastics used for printing are sustainable, as well as the energy required for 3D printing
	- inconsistency in objects printed
	- cyber risk (hacking printing designs)
	- copyright
	- low throughput for a single given printer?
