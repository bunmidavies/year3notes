[[UCIL20882]]

- pathophysiology sits at the intersection of [[pathology]] and [[physiology]] referring to the physiological processes associated, or as a result of disease - that is, the mechanisms of the disease
- in short, physiology = processes/mechanisms operating within an organism, pathology = conditions observed during a disease state. Pathophysiology tries to explain the internal mechanisms i.e. functional changes within the organism which are causing such observations in the disease state
