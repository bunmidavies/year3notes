[[UCIL20882]]

- seizures are synonymous with convulsions, and is a transient abnormal event resulting from the discharge of a cerebral [[neurone]]
- during convulsions, a person has continued uncontrollable shaking, that is rapid and rhythmic, with the muscles contracting and relaxing repeatedly
- [[epilepsy]] is the continued tendency to have such seizures

- Electroencephalograms (EEGs) can be used to detect whether a seizure is happening, but the obvious downside is that these need to be connected to a person, and seizures aren't exactly predictable

- generalised seizures refer to seizures which generally affect the entire brain, and include:
	- tonic clonic: grand mal - all limbs are twitching 
	- absence: petit mal
	- myoclonic - muscles everywhere are twitching, but the overall appearance isn't as strong as a tonic clonic seizure 

- partial seizures refer to seizures which affect only specific parts of the brain - some people are able to tell that they may be about to have a seizure, due to the ==induced aura== from partial seizures

# causes of seizures

- in 2/3rds of cases, no definite cause of a seizure is found, but a number of possible causes are known

- trauma - depressed skull fractures, penetrating brain injuries, cerebral contusions (brain bruise) and [[dural tears]] all increase the probability of seizures
- cerebrovascular - cerebral infractions can also increase the risk of seizures
- alcohol - excessive consumption of alcohol can result in ==hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)==, resulting in a seizure then coma
- brain tumours and pyrexia (a high fever) 

# diagnosis, treatment & prognosis

3 main steps for diagnosis include:
1. ruling out any other causes of seizures
2. eye witness accounts can be helpful
3. perform EEG

3 main actions to combat seizures include:
1. keeping safe while having a seizure - stay in spaces with soft items, non dangerous areas
2. never restrain someone who is having a seizure
3. immediate medication e.g. diazepam

in the long term, the following impacts may occur 
1. long term anti-epileptic medication may need to be taken
2. most people can lead a normal life
3. employment can be affected (for instance, pilots may have to have had no seizures in the past 10 years to fly a commercial plane)
