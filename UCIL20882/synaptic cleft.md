[[UCIL20882]]

- the synaptic cleft is the gap between the terminal axon of the pre-synaptic neuron, and the post-synaptic neuron
- the axon terminal of the pre-synaptic neuron contains a number of vesicles

- the gap between the axon terminal of a neuron and the cell body of another - they contain vesicles, which contain neurotransmitters (chemical messengers)  
  
- when an action potential reaches an axon terminal (due to the cell membrane potential passing the action potential threshold), vesicles fuse with the membrane of the presynaptic neuron - these vesicles burst open releasing the neurotransmitters, travelling across the cleft to bind with the post-synaptic neuron receptors (potentially causing an action potential in that post synaptic neuron)  
  
- receptors of neurons have a sort of lock and key mechanism, such that only certain neurotransmitters will 'fit' into receptors, activating the neuron
