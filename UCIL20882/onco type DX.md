[[UCIL20882]]

- identifies the underlying tumour biology for breast cancer
	- there are 16 genes associated with breast cancer, with 5 housekeeping genes (genes that shouldn't have been changed over the course of the test ?)
- these genes are detected, and a mathematical formula is used to calculate the reoccurence score (trademarked algorithm)
- a score between 1-100 is returned in order to determine whether chemotherapy is required - the likely reoccurence of a tumour within the next 10 years can also be checked

- onco type dx is typically used in patients that are positive for ER (oestrogen receptor) and negative for HER2 - a biopsy. is taken by a pathologist, with the tissue then sent to a genomic health lab
