[[UCIL20882]]

- like [[adult stem cells (ASCs)]], specifically bone marrow, the placenta and umbilical cord blood cells have HSCs and MSCs
- however, these are typically considered better than bone marrow as:
	- the stem cells are less immunogenic (have to evade mother's immune system - less surface markers, thus easier to match with recipient and less prone to [[immunocompatibility|rejection]])
	- the stem cells have longer [[telomeres + telomerase|telomeres]] (via expressing more telomerase)
	- the stem cells have less DNA damage
	- harvesting is non invasive
	- plasticity is the same
- however, these are of a very small quantity
