[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics)

- pharmacogenomics is the study of the genome in drug response, and how different people with different genetic makeup may respond to the same drug treatment - it is an idea commonly applied as part of [[precision medicine]]
- when the human genome project had started, only 4 drugs had any sort of pharmacogenomic information associated with them
- by the end of the project, 46 drugs with PGx information existed - today, there are 261 drugs with PGx information, and 362 drug-[[biomarkers|biomarker]] pairs
- a possible issue is the fact of how vast gene variations are - each person carries over a thousand gene variations that can determine drug response, and current tests might only cover a fraction of the relevant variations - therefore, pharmacogenomics for drug dosing may still be ineffectual as of now
- there are examples of PGx being both effective and ineffective, with popular failures being steve jobs, while other successes such as dr lukus wartman having his cancer genome sequence, and an 'overdrive' gene being targeted by treatment resulting in his cancer remitting

# example: liver metabolising enzyme mutations

- the cytochrome p450 family of enzymes are responsible for metabolising >90% of drugs, i.e. breaking them down such that they become useful
- there are thousands of mutations of genes in this family, which can lead to a number of effects or issues, for instance:
	- slow metabolisation = overdose toxicity may occur
	- ultra fast metabolisation = drugs are eliminated very quickly, such that they're not effective
- if the rate of metabolisation can be established, dosage of a certain drug can be adjusted in order to prevent issues from occurring - typically, it may be established which p450 enzyme breaks down the drug of concern, so figuring out that specific enzymes rate of metabolisation will be important

# example: clopidogrel

- ==example: Clopidogrel== - clopidogrel is used to prevent blood clotting, and is commonly used in people with stents implanted to keep arteries open: since stents can increase the risk of blood clots, clopidogrel can be taken to prevent clot formation
- clopidogrel is metabolised by CYP 2C19 - a P450 enzyme - this converts the inactive drug to an active drug, but variations in this enzyme lead to less conversion of the drug to an active state
- by performing genetic testing in order to identify which patients will not be able to metabolise the drug effectively, different treatment can be prescribed

# example: Ki67 in cancer

- Ki67 is a nuclear protein, and an established indicator when biopsies are taken for patients with cancer - the expression of Ki67 is strongly associated with tumour growth
- a reduction in Ki67 can then suggest that less cancer cells are present, therefore some treatment is working
- this may be more invasive than imaging, but if imaging isn't available than a biopsy to check Ki67 expression can be a suitable alternative
