[[UCIL20882]]

- cell potency becomes progressively restricted as an embryo develops

# totipotency

- when we are in the zygote stage, we only have one cell, so at this point this zygote can develop into a whole organism

# pluripotency

- at this point we are in the blastocyst stage - the ICM cells in the blastocyst can develop into any cell type in the body, but cannot create the placenta or umbilical cord (which differs the potency from totipotency), meaning these cells alone cannot make a new organism
- cells with these potential are also known as embryonic stem cells

# multipotency

- [[gastrulation]] occurs at this point, and cells belonging to the 3 germ layers have lost their pluripotency
- these cells are also known as multipotent stem cells, and can develop into a wide range of cell types, but ==not all==

# progenitor cells

- at this point the germ layer cell would have specialised to a point where it can only choose between 2 to 6 cell fates, and the cell itself is defined within a particular tissue
- when this cell fate is chosen/locked, the cell becomes a ==committed progenitor== - like the eye cells in the [[grafting experiments]] - differentiation is ongoing at this point

#  differentiated

- once a cell is differentiated, it has a clear-cut identity and expresses specific proteins for morphology or function
- this cell also no longer divides
