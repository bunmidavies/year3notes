[[UCIL20882]]

- companion diagnostics describes something developed alongside a drug in order to verify whether a particular patient will benefit/is suitable for treatment from a specific drug
- CDx's are FDA approved and help to accelerate a certain product reaching the market, allowing people to get teh help they need

- for instance, Zelboraf's CDx Cobas Platform detects the BRAF V600E mutation, via real time polymerase chain reaction
 - the main drawback is that currently only one company (CDx) is FDA approved, so they have somewhat of a monopoly on the companion market - they can charge whatever they want for the diagnostics and there are no competitors at this given time
