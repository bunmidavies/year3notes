[[UCIL20882]]

- companion diagnostics describes something developed alongside a drug in order to verify whether a particular patient will benefit/is suitable for treatment from a specific drug - obviously not every drug may be able to have this feature though
- CDx's are FDA approved and help to accelerate a certain product reaching the market, allowing people to get the help they need

- for instance, Zelboraf's (cancer treatment) CDx Cobas Platform detects the BRAF V600E mutation, via a real time PCR 
 - the main drawback is that currently only one company (CDx) is FDA approved, so they have somewhat of a monopoly on the companion market - they can charge whatever they want for the diagnostics and there are no competitors at this given time
