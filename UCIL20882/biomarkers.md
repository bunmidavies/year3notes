- a biomarker is "a naturally occurring molecule, gene, or characteristic by which a particular pathological or physiological process, disease, etc. can be identified"
- biomarkers can be detected in a wide range of areas, including:
	- tissue, both normal and diseased
	- blood
	- saliva
	- sweat
	- hair
- essentially, any part of the body

- biomarkers present a number of advantages:
	- we can firstly diagnose certain diseases with more ease/clarity
	- the risk of developing a disease may also be quantifiable (for instance BRCA1 mutation and the risk of breast cancer)
	- [[prognosis]] i.e. how the disease is likely to develop may also be predictable with the use of biomarkers
	- whether one will respond to a specific treatment can also be predicted using biomarkers (HER2 and trastuzumab in breast cancer), and general response to treatments can also be assessed (e.g. loss of ki67 as a marker of decreased proliferation in cancer)
	- biomarkers play an important role in [[pharmacogenomics (PGx)]] - for instance, Cyp450 enzymes in the liver altering the rate of breakdown of drugs
