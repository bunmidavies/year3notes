[[UCIL20882]]

- our ==genome== consists of all DNA molecules in each human cell - therefore, 46 molecules for each chromosome in the typical human cell
- our ==genome== contains genes which provide code for proteins - genes are essentially portions of the DNA strand, not necessarily continuously stored (i.e. there can be large gaps between one gene and another)

- DNA gets transcribed into RNA - Uracil replaces Thymine such that any Ts are replaced with U
- each triplet of bases forms a singular amino acid - amino acids then form ==proteins==
- proteins can work in isolation or with other proteins to carry out some specified function

- a gene's place on a chromosome is known as it's ==locus== - for each locus, there are two possible ==alleles==
- an [[allele]] is any of several forms of a gene, usually arising through mutation, that are responsible for any hereditary variation
