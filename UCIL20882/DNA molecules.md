## structure/composition
- the template for building all living organisms are found within a molecule called DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)
- DNA molecules are a ==double helix structure== - meaning there are two strands which coil around each other
- the strands are made up of 4 types of 'building blocks' i.e. [[nucleotides]], each of which have a letter base (A, C, G or T) which allow us to read out the order of 'building blocks' in the strand like a sequence
- these building blocks make up a singular [[gene]], and each molecule of DNA will have many genes - so essentially:
	- human cells contain a nucleus and cytoplasm
	- within the nucleus are 46 chromosomes
	- each chromosome contains DNA molecule
	- DNA molecule is 2 long strands of nucleotides
	- the strands contain many genes

- each DNA molecule is packed alongside proteins to form a [[chromosome]] - with 46 chromosomes in human cells, this corresponds to 46 DNA molecules

- in each mammalian cell, DNA molecules are found in the nucleus, supercoiled and packed into what appears to be a 'messy' structure
- within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organised into long structures called [[chromosome|chromosomes]]
