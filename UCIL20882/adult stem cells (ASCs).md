[[UCIL20882]]

- adult stem cells are in fact also found in children, and also known as somatic stem cells
- ASCs are present in many tissues, but often quite rare and divide infrequently - there are also multiple types of ASC
- ASCs are harder to grow/differentiate in the lab, and are only [[cell levels of potency#multipotency|multipotent]] (but in labs may show some plasticity i.e. in between multipotent and pluripotent)
- ASCs typically already belong to a given germ layer, but the majority have the capacity to ==trans-differentiate== in the lab into cells from a different germ layer
- the most plastic cells are MSCs, but this process as a whole isn't very efficient

# hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)

- most commonly found in bone marrow, to create blood cells

# mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)

- used for creating connective tissue types e.g. bone, cartilage, tendons, muscle and fat cells
