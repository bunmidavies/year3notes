[[UCIL20882]]

- an ==allele== is any of several forms of a gene, usually arising through mutation, that are responsible for any hereditary variation
- a specific gene always resides within one gene locus
- allele frequency (whether an allel is rare or common within a population) is linked to the ==genetic fitness== it provides its carriers in a given environment

- genetic fitness = reproductive success: survival to reproductive age + mating success + healthy progeny
- alleles that provide an advantage are more likely to be passed on and persist/become more prominent within a population
- if an environment changes, allele frequency within the population can shift - this is otherwise known as ==micro-evolution==

# polymorphisms

- at each gene locus, an individual has one of two polymorphisms, depending on the chromosomes and alleles inhereted from parents - this leads to hereditary variation
	- heterozygous = paternal allele is different to maternal allele
	- homozygous = paternal allele is the same as maternal allele

# dominance, recessiveness, co-dominance

- if an allele codes for a non functioning/less effective protein, it will be ==recessive==, because the protein coded by the other allele will take over and be dominant
