[[UCIL20882]]

- ==an allele is version of a gene==, usually arising through mutation, that is responsible for any hereditary variation - it can be sort of thought of as the actual instance of a [[genes|gene]] within the gene locus (?)
- a specific [[gene]] always resides within one gene locus - most human cells carry two copies of each chromosome (one from each parent), so will usually have two alleles
- allele frequency (whether an allel is rare or common within a population) is linked to the ==genetic fitness== it provides its carriers in a given environment

- genetic fitness = reproductive success: survival to reproductive age + mating success + healthy progeny
- alleles that provide an advantage are more likely to be passed on and persist/become more prominent within a population
- if an environment changes, allele frequency within the population can shift - this is otherwise known as ==micro-evolution==

# polymorphisms

- polymorphism is the idea that several alleles can exist for one gene locus
- at each gene locus, an individual has one of two polymorphisms, depending on the chromosomes and alleles inherited from parents - this leads to hereditary variation
	- heterozygous = paternal allele is different to maternal allele -
	- homozygous = paternal allele is the same as maternal allele

# dominant, recessive and co-dominant alleles

- ==dominant== alleles mask the presence of other alleles - an organism only needs one copy out of the two in order to show characteristics of any traits associated with the allele
- dominant alleles are essentially making a more effective protein than its counterpart, or a protein that prevents the other protein from working

- ==recessive== alleles code for a non functioning or less effective protein, and two copies of a recessive allele are required to show characteristics of the trait associated with that allele

- ==co-dominant== alleles encode equally functional proteins in the same quantity as their counterpart, meaning characteristics from both traits associated with according alleles will be present
