- though it is agreed that as a cell specialises it loses its [[cell levels of potency|potency]], in 1997 this idea was challenged
- cloning dolly essentially proved that a ==differentiated cell== (i.e. a cell which shouldn't be able to divide and has a locked purpose) can give rise to a new organism, essentially making it [[cell levels of potency#totipotency|totipotent]]
- in the diagram shown above, it is believed that whatever the differentiated cells were cultured in, allowed its DNA to be reprogrammed
- this was not known at the time which is what allowed this experiment to challenge the notion that specialised cells lose their ability to differentiate
- what this did prove though is that cells are ==genomically equivalent== (genes are **not** lost), but the DNA must be reprogrammed in order to regain totipotency
