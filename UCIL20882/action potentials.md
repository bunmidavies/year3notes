[[UCIL20882]]

- as you stimulate the cell, more sodium diffuses, causing the overall charge of the cell membrane to increase - if a certain threshold is reached, an ==action potential== is given off
- at 30mV ==depolarisation== occurs
- repolarisation then occurs (due to the ==sodium/potassium pump==), and the cell charge decreases
