[[UCIL20882]]

- phage therapy aka bacteriophage therapy has been seen as a potential alternative to antibiotics
- bacteriophage are viruses that infect bacteria, discovered in 1915 and 1917 independently, with an estimated $10^{31}$ believed to exist on earth
- they typically spike themselves onto the cell wall of bacteria, then inject DNA into the bacteria, which then may cause one of two things:
	- lytic bacteriophage - kills the bacteria
	- lysogeny - infects bacteria then lays dormant

- phages are ==highly specific== to a strain of bacteria species, having been used in the 1930s to kill bacteria, despite having a lack of efficacy and being 'oversold' (thus leading to the superseding of antibiotics)
- in the 1950s, the soviet union was particularly interested in phages, making cocktails of phage preparations (but research being published in russian limited its accessibility)
- however, the continuing emergence of antibiotic resistance has made phages continue to look more attractive

# issues

- phages are immunogenic, thus cleared from blood - this may mean only localised use of phages can be viable
- in 2006, the FDA granted GRAS licensing (Generally Regarded As Safe) for a disinfectant spray on animal feed, using phage against food-poisoning bacteria (Listeria)
- a few cases of human use have also been documented:
	- in 2007, small-scale studies against ear infections used phages
	- fully sequenced phages have been used for leg ulcers
	- E. coli diarrhoeal disease has been combatted with phages in Bangladesh
	- other 'compassionate use' cases exist i.e. where antibiotics have failed

# pros & cons

- pros include:
	- low dosages being required, since maybe only one phage is required which can then spread its DNA within hosts
	- few side effects are believed to occur
	- normal microflora is also not killed (which antibiotics may do)
	- resistance may be less of an issue if cocktails are used
- cons include:
	- little being known about the biology of phages
	- phages need to be selected carefully due to their specificity
	- worry regarding the release of toxins from the phage
	- strains of phages also appear to have clinical variation
	- IP/patenting issues
