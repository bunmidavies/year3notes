[[UCIL20882]]

- otherwise known as hospital-acquired infections and ==nosocomial infections==, HAIs/HCAIs typically occur as a result of micro-organisms being carried by patients entering a hospital, or immuno-compromised patients
- common 'problem bacteria', otherwise known as ==nosocomial bacteria== describe the bacteria that typically cause such infections
- the most common examples include:
	- methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus auereus* ([[MRSA]])
	- *pseudomonas aeruginosa* - lung infections (esp. cystic fibrosis), being naturally resistant to many antibiotics and growing as a biofilm
	- *clostridioides difficile* (c. difficile) - diarrhoeal infection predominantly in ill patients, with spores not being killable by alcohol hand gel, and antibiotic-resistance being observed
	- carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE) - commensal on skin and in the gut, causing urine infections, wound infections, pneumonia and speticaemia - resistant to many antibiotics
