[[UCIL20882]]

- the zygote is the fertilised sex cell - it is a singular cell created from the fusion of [[gametes]] (e.g. egg and sperm)

# development of embryo (from zygote)

- the zygote firstly divides into many cells via [[mitosis]] - once we have two cells, each cell is known as a ==blastomere==
- this division continues until we have a ==blastocyst==
- cells which are set aside to the top of the blastocyst are known as the ==inner cell mass== (ICM), which turn into an embryo
- the surrounding cells are known as the ==trophoblast== - these are extra embryonic membranes (i.e. the placenta) existing to help the future embryo as it develops

- this process happens while the egg moves through the fallopian tubes - eventually, the egg is implanted due to being driven by the trophoblast - the ICM expands and changes shape and location (but remains to be made up of a single type of cell)

- at this point, the body 'axes' (i.e. coordinates) are set up to have a 'primitive streak' - anterior posterior axis -
