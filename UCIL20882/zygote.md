[[UCIL20882]]

- the zygote is the fertilised sex cell - it is a singular cell created from the fusion of [[gametes]] (e.g. egg and sperm)
- the zygote is larger than most cells of the body and is visible to the human eye

# development of embryo (from zygote)

- the zygote firstly divides into many cells via [[mitosis]] - once we have two cells, each cell is known as a ==blastomere==
- this division continues until we have a [[blastocyst]], roughly on the 5th day after fertilisation

- cells which are set aside to the top of the blastocyst are known as the ==inner cell mass== (ICM) - the ICM has the cells which will give rise to actual fetal cells
- the surrounding cells are known as the ==trophoblast== - these are extra embryonic membranes (i.e. the placenta) existing to help the future embryo as it develops
