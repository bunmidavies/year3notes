[[UCIL20882]]

- bacteria can overcome a type of antbiotics through a number of mechanisms - for instance:
	- some bacteria can have a stronger cell wall making it impenetrable by certain antibiotics
	- some bacteria can cause drug inactivation
	- certain bacteria may have [efflux pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efflux_pump) in order to essentially remove antibiotics from the bacteria
	- the antibiotic's 'target' within the bacteria can be modified such that the antibiotic's original target effectively doesn't exist any longer
	- target bypass is also possible

# arise

- bacteria can acquire genes from other bacteria (horizontal transfer of plasmid DNA)
- bacteria can also grow quickly and mutations can arise very quickly - for instance bacteria develops a mutation that repurposes structures to remove antibiotics
- the overuse of antibiotics, animal husbandry (animal food often has small amounts of antibiotics to prevent infection) and stopping antibiotics too soon (thus bacteria doesn't get killed off)

# alternative approaches

- historically, natural compounds were able to be composed via semi-synthetic/synthetic methods
- within the genetic era, genome analysis led to the aim to find likely candidate genes for antibiotics
- within the post-genome era, screening libraries of older compounds and systems biology could play parts in new approaches
- additionally, targeting signalling messengers ([[quorum sensing]]) between bacteria and [[phage therapy]] may also be effective
- by killing off QS signals, bacteria may survive, but wont be able to thrive
