[[UCIL20882]]

- bacteria can overcome a type of antbiotics through a number of mechanisms - for instance, some bacteria can have a stronger cell wall making it impenetrable by certain antibiotics
- the 'target' of the antibiotic can be modified such that the antibiotic's original target effectively doesn't exist any longer

# arise
- bacteria can acquire genes from other bacteria (horizontal transfer of plasmid DNA)
- bacteria can also grow quickly and mutations can arise very quickly - for instance bacteria develops mutation that repurposes structure to remove antibiotics
- the overuse of antibiotics, animal husbandry (animal food often has small amounts of antibiotics to prevent infection) and stopping antibiotics too soon (thus bacteria doesn't get killed off)
