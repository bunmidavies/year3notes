[[UCIL20882]]

- all adult cells have the ==same== surface proteins that are recognised as self by our own immune system, so that it doesn't attack our own cells (like an ID card)
- this surface is encoded by 5 genes with ==several co-dominant alleles== (5 maternal proteins + 5 paternal proteins)

- if a transplant of cells is taking place and the donor cells proteins don't match with the recipient cells proteins, antibodies will begin to attack the donor cell - this leads to ==transplant rejection==
- there is a level of tolerance for foreign cells not presenting the same surface proteins, but it is limited
