# telomeres

- telomeres are made of non-coding DNA repeats, designed to protect the chromosomes - sort of like metal caps on the ends
- with each mitosis, several ==telomeric repeats== do not get replicated - this means the telomeres get shorter, reducing the proliferative potential of a cell
- when a cell has divided so many times, it has no telomeres, and information would be lost if the cell were to divide any further

# telomerase

- cells expressing telomerase can protect their telomeres - the level of expression of telomerase influences the proliferation capacity of a cell
