[[UCIL20882]]

- Parkinsons is a neurodegenerative disorder, with over 145k people in the UK having the disease
- caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but there are also lifestyle choices which strangely protect people from disease (for instance, smoking is known to reduce the risk of Parkinsons)
- other known factors which impact Parkinsons include:
	- drinking coffee
	- well water
	- rural living 
	- pesticides

- a resting tremor, rigidity and akinesia (poor movement) are the ==motor triad== of symptoms associated with Parkinsons disease - however, these are not early signs of the disease
- other symptoms which may indicate early Parkinsons disease include:
	- loss of smell
	- sleep disorders
	- constipation
	- depression
	- anxiety
	- mask like face

- the basal ganglia is responsible for subconscious control of movement & coordination of learned movement - this collection of nuclei lie deep in the brain within the grey matter
- the substantia nigra moderates the activity of the basal ganglia with the neurotransmitter dopamine - Parkinsons involves the loss of dopamine producing neurones in the substantia nigra
- ==lewy bodies== (aka foreign substances) within neurones, disrupting their normal neuronal functioning
- $\alpha$-synuclein is the main contituent of lewy bodies, and it is possible that this can be treated as a possible [[biomarkers|biomarker]]

# diagnosis + treatment

- a clinical diagnosis is made for Parkinsons - patients typically live 10-15 years from diagnosis, and death is usually caused by bronchopneumonia (a type of pneumonia affecting the lungs)
