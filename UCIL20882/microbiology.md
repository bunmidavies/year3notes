- microbiology is predominantly concerned with disease and infections - microbiologists are typically concerned with any new and emerging infections

- a lot of old diseases are now known to be microbiological - for instance, stuomach ulcers (helicobacter pylon), cancer (HPV), multiple sclerosis (EBV)
- conversely, many old infections can re-emerge due to it becoming resistant to treatment, or incorrectly thought to have been eradicated
- it is also common for recognised infectious diseases to spread to new populations (for instance the Zika/Ebola viruses emerging from remote areas)

- microbiologists also aim to discover new tricks & roles for bacteria
