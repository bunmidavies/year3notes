[[UCIL20882]]

- a few factors account for cell differences - a cell's ID mainly depends on the proteins present within that cell, so this depends on the genes it expresses (turn 'on')
- ==cells do not express all their genes== - at any given time, a cell expresses about 20% of its genes
- of these 20% expressed, 10% are [[developmental genes]] - i.e. genes which create differences within the cell amongst other cells
- the other 90% are known as 'housekeeping' genes, which all cells need

- cells start to express different genes due to maternal proteins deposited in the egg - ==these proteins are not distributed uniformly==
- cleavage divisions will not duplicate everything such that resulting cells are completely identical - this means that blastomeres after a number of divisions will not have the same maternal proteins in their cytoplasm
- this leads to different gene expression, which causes the cascade of different proteins being expressed, and more differences with each division
