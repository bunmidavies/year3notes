- there are a number of ways in which diseases can re-emerge:
	- old infections can re-emerge due to becoming resistant to treatment: e.g. XDR-TB (extensively drug-resistant TB)
	- diseases thought to have been eradicated, but ultimately re-emerged (syphilis; chlamydia)
	- recognised infection spreading to new populations (e.g. Zika/ebola)
	- new infections resulting from changes in existing microorganisms (e.g. bird/swine flu; SARS)
