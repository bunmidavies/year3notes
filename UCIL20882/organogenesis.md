 - organogenesis is a progressive process in which the head-to-tail framework (AP axis) is used as a reference by the three ==germ layers== in order to form the internal organs of an organism
 - the cells of each of the germ layers undergo [[cell differentiation]] where they go from less-specialised to more-specialised through the expression of a specific set of genes
