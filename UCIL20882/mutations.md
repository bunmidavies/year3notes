[[UCIL20882]]

- a mutation is a permanent alteration in DNA, passed onto daughter cells and sometimes [[gametes]] - different types of mutations can occur, including:
	- a single base pair alteration
	- entire segments of chromosomes i.e. multiple genes

- mutations are typically acquired in 2 ways:
	- ==hereditary== = inherited from parent gamete
	- ==somatic/acquired== = occurs at some point of a persons life, which could be via:
		- mutagens/environmental factors
		- biological factors, integrated into the genome
		- errors during DNA replication before [[mitosis]]
		- errors during DNA repair
		- errors during [[meiosis]] - specifically when chromosomes are replicated

# types of mutation

- mutations can be split into two categories - micro and macro
## macro mutations
- macro mutations affect chromosomes, and occur during [[meiosis]]
