- the human genome project (1990-2003) was a scientific research project resulting in the first sequence of the human [[genes|genome]] being produced - by 2004, the complete draft of the human genome was published

# HGP findings

### humans only have ~20,500 genes
- before HGP, we assumed that different organisms must have very different genes, and more 'complex' organisms must have many more genes than simpler organisms - flies have 13,000 so by that logic humans should have > 100k genes
- in fact, humans were found to have around 20,000 genes, with 60% of these being similar between a fly and human
- ==only 2% of human DNA codes for genes== - most genes can code for more than one [[proteins|protein]] through ==alternative splicing== (cells have the same genome but wont have the same genes and isoforms)

### humans are 99.9% identical
- 0.1% variation = 1 in 1000 base pairs vary $\therefore$ about 3 million base pairs differ in each human
- the majority of these base pair differences are the result of [[single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)]]
- additionally, many of these SNPs occur outside genes (thus having no effect on phenotype)

### the location of 1,400 disease-causing mutations were identified
- before HGP, we knew <100 locations - now, ==landmarks== in specific chromosomes/parts of the genome exist indicating where certain disease-causing mutations may be found
