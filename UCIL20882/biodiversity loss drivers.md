[[UCIL20882]]

- common biodiversity loss drivers include:
	- deforestation and other land degradation
	- pollution
	- climate change
	- overexploitation
	- invasive species
- ==the key factor in extinction is the loss of genetic variation== - variation is necessary in order for evolutionary responses to evolutionary change to take place. Small populations are very prone to loss of variation, and loss of variation itself can lead to more loss of variation, resulting in a positive feedback loop manner (causing an [[extinction vortex]])

# factors contributing to extinction chance

- population density
- spread of species - i.e. whether its found over a small or large area - ==endemic species== i.e. species that only exist in one geographic region are particularly vulnerable to extinction
- example: in costa rica, 5/10 endemic species are under the threat of extinction
- whether the species has a specialised or generalised niche
- reproductive rate of the species

- example of species exhibiting low factors: Jaguar
- example of species exhibiting high factors: Racoon
