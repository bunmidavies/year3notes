[[UCIL20882]]

- alzheimers is a degenerative disease, and the most common cause of [[dementia]] - over half a million people in the UK have it
- ==dementia is an umbrella term== for cognitive issues including memory issues, problem solving issues, language and cognitive skills

# hallmarks of Alzheimers

- $\beta$-amyloid plaques outside neruones, as well as protein tau (tangles) inside neurones are common hallmarks of alzheimer's disease - both of these block communication at synapses, and block the transport of nutrients into neurones
- risk factors also include:
	- genetics (APP, presenilin 1 & 2)
	- downs syndrome (3 copies of chromosome 21)
	- age
	- education (the longer you study, the less likely you are to develop alzheimers)

# effects on brain tissue

- brain tissue generally shrinks, which is one of the main causes of the functional/cognitive decline

# diagnosis + treatment

- diagnosis is currently clinical, but input from close friends and family, as well as medical history
- cognitive tests and a neurological examination is also performed
- blood tests aren't used to diagnose Alzheimer's, but can be used to rule out other causes (e.g. B12 deficiency, cancers)

- acetylocholine esterase inhibitor drugs are used to keep the neurotransmitter in the synapse for longer, and help neurones to communicate better

# modifiable risk factors

- having good cardiovascular health protects against dementia, as brain health is affected by heart health
