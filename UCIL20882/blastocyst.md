- the blastocyst is formed after about 5 days of ==fertilization== of the female gamete

- once the blastocyst has formed, implantation occurs, where the blastocyst is embedded into the ==endriometral lining== of the uterus
- this process happens while the egg moves through the fallopian tubes - eventually, the egg is implanted due to being driven by the trophoblast - the ICM expands and changes shape and location (but remains to be made up of a single type of cell)
- the blastocyst aligns itself accordingly to allow the ICM to enter the the uterine lining first

- at this point, the body 'axes' (i.e. coordinates) are set up to have a 'primitive streak' - anterior posterior axis -
