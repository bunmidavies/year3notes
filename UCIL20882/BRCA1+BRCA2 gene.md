- the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes are both examples of genes that can help to identify whether a person is at risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer
- these genes are typically protective against breast cancer, however, certain mutations can massively alter the chance of breast/ovarian cancer

- positive mutations = 85% lifetime chance of breast cancer; 60% lifetime chance of ovarian cancer
- negative mutations = 13% lifetime chance of breast cancer; 0.7% lifetime chance of ovarian cancer
