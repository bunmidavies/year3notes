- mullerian mimicry is the phenomenon of separate species (and often very distant species) could mimic each others characteristics to send a warning to predators that have come across at least one species sharing the characteristics, essentially fooling the predator
- for example: the *Heliconius* butterfly mimics species from the *Melinaea* butterflies, in order to deter predators - different variations of the *Heliconius* themselves also mimic each other across different areas of south america
