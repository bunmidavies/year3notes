[[UCIL20882]]

- umbrella species make conservation easier since their conservation indirectly conserves many other species in an [[ecosystem]]
- umbrella species may or may not play a fundamental role themselves, but their value is tied to its geographical species range - i.e. the number of locations that the species spans over
- essentially, choosing to conserve one umbrella species can help to inadvertently conserve other species, but this species could have 0 impact on the actual wellbeing of any ecosystem/related species

# example: Green Macaw

- the green macaw is an umbrella species found in Costa Rica, that can open hard seeds of the alemandro tree that many animals cannot
- the alemandro tree itself is endangered due to unsustainable farming, is a keystone species and is endemic to Costa Rica
