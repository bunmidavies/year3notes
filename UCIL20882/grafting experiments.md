[[UCIL20882]]

- other grafting experiments also supported the findings in the [[the gurdon cloning experiment]], as well as other points:
- a cell's 'fate' can be found to be locked before it even differentiates, through a grafting experiment:
	1. tissue from a late blastula/early gastula that would later become an eye was transplanted into an older host embryo, but in different locations (one where the kidney should be, another where the eye should be, and a third where the ear should be)
	2. tissue from a neurula (early vertebrae embryo) that would later become an eye was also transplated into another older host embryo, in similar locations to 1
- what was found is that the late blastula/early gastula tissue managed to develop into the correct organs depending on its location, while the neurula tissue developed into an eye in all 3 locations
- these cells had not differentiated yet, but clearly had already had what they were going to differentiate into predecided
