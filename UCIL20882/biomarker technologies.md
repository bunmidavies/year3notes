- a range of technologies can be employed in order to identify DNA / genetic biomarker(s) from a patient:
	- DNA sequencing (sequencing your whole genome)
	- PCR
	- microarrays
- ideally we want to look at a single gene or protein, but in some cases we may want to look at multiple individual genes or proteins, or multiple variations in genes or proteins, or a signature which tells us how multiple gene/proteins/variations together contribute towards a disease
