[[UCIL20882]]

- a somatic cell is a cell in the body ==other than the sperm or egg== (those being known to start off as [[germ cells]]) - in humans, somatic cells are ==diploid==, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes (one from each parent, making 46 in total)
- any DNA [[mutations]] to somatic cells do not affect germ cells, meaning that these mutations cannot be passed onto offspring
