- the traditional approach to medicine is a "one size" fits all - blockbuster drugs prescribed for the "typical" patient
- however, this is obviously not successful for everyone, since patients and their environments are different

- precision medicine takes individual differences into account - ==the right medicine, at the right time at the right dose==
- precision medicine and treatment is typically known to be much more expensive than traditional medicine

*Precision Medicine: Tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient, usually involving patients being classified into subpopulations*

- certain worries about precision medicine include the fact that it may lead to more health inequalities - for instance, different patients may not receive the right treatments, or the same opportunities from treatments
- additionally, precision medicine can typically be very expensive (Â£10-20k a year is possible), and may be inaccessible based on where you live, or what health board you're on

- the idea of precision medicine isn't new - a number of instances across history involve some idea of personalisation:
	- 1902: Sir Archibald Garrod noticed that alkaptunoria appeared to be inherited
	- 1907: Reuban Ottenberg performed the first blood transfusion, with the aid of blood compatibility testing
	- 1956: US army researches discovered the genetic basis of selective toxicity of primaquine, an anti malarial drug
	- 1977: The role of cytochrome p450 metabolising enzyme variation in overdose toxicity with desbrisoquine was discovered
	- 2003: The end of the human genome project began the real era of personalised medicine


- for precision medicine, we generally take a number of factors into account, typically relying on [[biomarkers]] to allow us to know what characteristics are present:
	- genomics
	- transcriptomics
	- proteomic
	- lipidomics
	- metabolomics
	- epigenomics
	- changes in function, expression, interaction, physiological measurement

- precision medicine isn't limited to genes and drugs - other examples of applications include:
	- tinnitus masker
	- software-based quantitative EEG (brain waves) analysis (useful for [[epilepsy]])
	- artificial pancreas device system
	- custom made splints

# advantages of precision medicine

- precision medicine presents advantages to clinicians, patients, and more or less anyone thats involved in some sort of treatment
- precision medicine can help with stratifying patients for clinical trials - it may become easier to pick up drug effects in the same mutation group, rather than in a mixed population, ultimately helping the chance of a positive outcome of trials
- umbrella trial = 1 type of cancer with different genetic mutations, tested against different drugs
- basket trial = multiple types of cancer with the same genetic mutation, tested against the same drug
