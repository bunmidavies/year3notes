[[UCIL20882]]

- the traditional approach to medicine is a "one size" fits all - blockbuster drugs prescribed for the "typical" patient
- however, this is obviously not succesful for everyone, since patients and their environments are different

- precision medicine takes individual differences into account - ==the right medicine, at the right time at the right dose==
- precision medicine and treatment is typically known to be much more expensive than traditional medicine

- the idea of precision medicine isn't new
- for precision medicine, we generally take a number of factors into account, typically relying on [[biomarkers]] to allow us to know what characteristics are present:
	- genomics
	- transcriptomics
	- proteomic
	- lipidomics
	- metabolomics
	- epigenomics

- precision medicine isn't limited to genes and drugs - other examples of applications include:
	- tinnitus masker
	- software-based quantitative EEG (brain waves) analysis
	- artificial pancreas device system
	- custom made splints
