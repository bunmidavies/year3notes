[[UCIL20882]]

- the main question the study of human development answers is:
==how does a single cell (the fertilised egg) become trillions of cells with 220 cell types organised in tissues and organs?==

- the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgT5rUQ9EmQ) provides an overview:
	- an egg cell in the ovary gets fertilised by sperm (which travelled down the fallopian tubes) - this fertilised cell is known as a [[zygote]]
	- the 'cleavage' process occurs now i.e. the zygote duplicates via mitosis while moving down the fallopian tube, forming the [[blastocyst]] (takes about 5 days) consisting of the inner cell mass (ICM) giving rise to the whole animal, and outer cells giving rise to the placenta
	- the blastocyst implants into the uterus (icm aligning with lining/wall of uterus) - the pregnancy is technically 'initiated' at this point
	- the ICM at this point will form a 'embroynic disk', which includes the [[primitive streak]] in the middle, giving rise to the 'head to tail' axis which can be visualised in humans
	- [[gastrulation]] then occurs, meaning ICM cells of the embryonic disk migrate into the axis formed, forming the 'germ layers' of the disk:
		- [[ectoderm]] - at the top
		- [[mesoderm]] - in the middle
		- [[endoderm]] - at the bottom
	- at this point, [[neurogenesis]] occurs - the neural tube (which connects to your brain and the rest of the central nervous system) starts to form, as well as the [[somites]] (which eventually form [[vertebrae]], forming the vertebral column) + spinal cord (which the vertebrae encloses)
	- [[organogenesis]] is the next process, in which the head-to-tail framework (i.e. the vertebral column formed by somites) is used as a reference axis

- through this process, we've gone from 1 cell type, to 2 once we reach [[blastocyst]] stage, to 3 after [[gastrulation]], and differentiation essentially handles the rest
