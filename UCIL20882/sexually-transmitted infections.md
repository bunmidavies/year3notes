[[UCIL20882]]

- being the most common category of re-emergent diseases, the two most common STDs are ==chlamydia== and ==gonorrhoea==
- though often asymptomatic, symptoms in chlamydia and gonorrhoea are both due to:
	- cell destruction/loss of function, evident within discharge
	- host inflammatory response
- untreated cases can lead to miscarriage, premature birth, eye infections in new-borns, or pelvic inflammatory disease/infertility/arthritis

# chlamydia
- *Chlamyida trachomatis*
- gram negative cocco/bacilli (2 different morphologies), difficult to see in a light microscope
- obligate intracellular bacteria (obligated to live within other cells to replicate), which survives within epithelial cells
- pain on urination/unusual discharge

# gonorrhoea
- *Neisseria gonnorhoeae*
- gram negative cocci, adhering (sitting outside) to epithelial cells of the urethra/cervix to multiply
- cell invasion can also occur
- thicker, yellow-green discharge
- resistance to Azithromycin (protein synthesis inhibitor) and Ceftriaxone (cell-wal inhibitor) was reported in 2018

# syphilis
- *Treponema pallidum*
- unusual shape and cell wall (spirochaetal), being hard to grow in the lab (due to intracellular growth & being anaerobic), and no known animal model to exist
- four main stages in the infection process are known to exist, with the tertiary/final stage known to cause neurological damage
- worries also exist about syphilis due to its ability to cross the placenta, causing problems for new-borns
