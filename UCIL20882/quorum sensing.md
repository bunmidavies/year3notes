[[UCIL20882]]

- quorum sensing is how bacteria 'talk' to each other - bacteria communicate with each other via small signalling molecules
- bacteria emit 'autoinducers', small proteins/RNA molecules which bind to receptors in/on bacterial cells, altering its gene expression
- this will typically happen when a higher number of auto inducers bind to the bacteria, and pass some ==critical threshold== (in order for a gene to be turned on or turned off)

- examples include bacteria producing toxins, switching off flagella (movement), or activating bioluminescence as a group
