[[UCIL20882]]

- certain biomarkers can be associated with specific drugs to indicate how treatment is going, and whether certain treatment is appropriate for a patient
- for example, 25-30% of patients with breast cancer are HER2 (human epidermal growth factor) positive, resulting in abnormal cell growth due to the HER2 receptor being overexpressed
- by blocking this receptor with Trastuzumab, tumours can be reduced, helping with chemotherapy
- however, if this gene isn't expressed, then the drug obviously isn't going to provide any benefit
- issues may also lie in how reproducible certain tests are - how well a certain biopsy has been taken may affect test results
