[[UCIL20882]]

- the amplichip is used to analyse the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes in order to determine the metabolic capacity of a person
- refer to [[pharmacogenomics (PGx)]] for more information about metabolisation, but different metabolisation rates within patients may suggest different required dosages, if not completely different treatments
- microarray-based tests also exist, which use DNA purified from blood (FDA approved) to identify metabolic capacity
