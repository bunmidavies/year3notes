[[UCIL20882]]

- there are 4 general factors which contribute to a region counting as a hotspot
	1. relatively small area
	2. high species richness
	3. contains a large number of endemics
	4. contains a large number of rare/endangered species
- certain conservation boards will have some variation to these rules e.g. conservation international counts a hotspot to have at least 1.5k vascular plants as endemics, and have less than 30% of its original natural vegetation - making it both essential and endangered
- these different criteria may not align when considered individually - for instance, one area which may meet the requirement to be a hotspot purely based on species richness, may not meet the requirement to be a hotspot if only the number of threatened species was accounted for

- around the world, 36 areas qualify as hotspots - their intact habitats represent 2.5% of earths land surface, but support more than half of the worlds plant species as endemics and nearly 43% of bird, mammal, reptile and amphibia species as endemics
