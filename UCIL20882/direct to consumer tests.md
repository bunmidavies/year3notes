[[UCIL20882]]

- direct to consumer tests are tests which usually require a biological specimen (e.g. saliva) which is then sent to a company for analysis
- popular examples include the 23 & me test (named as such due to humans having 23 pairs of chromosomes), where users send some sort of non hazardous sample of their genome, allowing scientists to examine:
	- microbiome
	- toxins
	- ancestry
	- prediction of disease risk

# case study - history of 23 & me / consumer companies

- launched in 2007 after approval, and was the first company to offer autosomal (non sex chromosome) DNA ancestry testing
- by 2013, it stopped its personal genome service in the US (due to failing to provide evidence to the FDA that what they were doing was up to a certain standard), but still offered ancestry service
- in 2014, these kits were then launchd in Canada and the UK
- around 2015-2016 the FDA approved numerous "carrier" tests for diseases - so instead of sequencing a humans entire genome, they just check for the presence of certain diseases
- many of these companies established partnerships with different pharmaceutical companies (for instance, GSK)
