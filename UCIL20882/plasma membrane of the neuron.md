[[UCIL20882]]

- the plasma membrane of every neuron is selectively permeable, meaning some things are allowed through, and other things are stopped
- the membrane has a number of channels, each allowing specific elements through the membrane or not (e.g. potassium channel, sodium channel, etc.)

- a cell at resting membrane potential has a negative charge -70mV - this is because at rest, more sodium is outside the cell than inside the cell, due to the sodium channels being closed - as sodium ions carry positive charge, this is why the resting membrane potential is negative
- when a cell is stimulated (light hitting the neuron, pain etc), the sodium channels open, causing sodium to diffuse from the higher concentration outside into the lower concentration inside - the potassium channels close causing no movement - this is known as ==depolarisation== (cell becoming very positive)
- the cell's depolarising current gives way to an action potential, an 'explosion' of electrical activity, which represents the neuron sending information down the axon - this is a binary event, meaning it is either all sent or not
- this action potential is given off provided the membrane potential passes a certain action potential threshold - the cell then loses its positive charge due to the sodium/potassium pump (repolarisation)
