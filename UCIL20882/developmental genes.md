[[UCIL20882]]

- developmental genes generally control the expression or silencing of other genes
- these developmental genes can control the expression of other developmental genes, meaning that a single initial difference in gene expression can lead to many differences cascading
- e.g. a developmental gene which turns on another developmental gene which turns off some other developmental gene which turns off another developmental gene ...
- this ultimately leads to [[cell differences]] resulting in [[cell differentiation]]

- developmental genes code for various proteins including:
	- proteins that ==regulate gene expression==, i.e. turn other genes ON or OFF
	- proteins involved in cell ==communication/signalling== - through cell signals, cell A could tell cell B to turn certain genes ON or OFF
