- in short, there are some general points about lab-based work that may be problematic:
	- experimenter bias - the experimenter can bias laboratory work via aspects such as the guinea pig effect or role bias ([[qualitative evaluation methods]])
	- obtrusive observation - see [[qualitative evaluation methods#unobtrusive methods]]
	- not longitudinal - experiments cannot account for users changing states over time, and experience
	- not ecologically valid - see [[ecological validity]]. These results are valid in the lab, but unconfirmed in the real world
