- digital phenotyping (DP) - defined by Jukka-Pekka Onnela in 2015 - can be thought of as an extension to [[human in the loop systems (HITL)]] - a human within a DP system carries around a mobile device/wearable, their behaviour in the real world is monitored and the collected data is used to make inferences about their behaviour
- data collected may typically be analysed using machine learning algorithms, in order to generate insights

- the steps within an ML based digital phenotyping approach may take the following steps:
	1. Data collection - typically from smartphones, wearables, data collected includes GPS location, accelerometer, gyroscope readings, screen interaction patterns
	2. Data processing + Feature extraction - raw data is converted into meaningful features and/or variables representing specific behaviours
	3. ML + pattern recognition - extracted features are analysed in order to identify patterns, trends and anomalies
	4. Behaviour modelling + prediction - behavioural models representing behaviour, and predictive models can be created using patterns previously recognised
	5. Continuous monitoring + feedback - individuals continue to be monitored, for instance real time insights may be provided
	6. Integration with clinical + research applications - the insights generated may be integrated into other applications. For instance, health professionals may use insights found in order to inform treatment decisions

- data collected can be classified as passive and active
	- active = data requiring active input from the user
	- passive = collected in the background e.g. sensor data

### DP applications in healthcare
- mental health mointoring - digital data like smartphone usage, social media activity, communication patterns
- mood + stress management - activity levels like sleep quality, and communcation patterns can detect patterns related to mood change
- cognitive function assessment
- physical health monitoring
- personalised interventions + treatment
- population health studies - by applying digital phenotyping to large scale populations, disease patterns can be understood, and population-level health trends can be studied to inform public health strategies
- behaviour change + wellness promotion

### digital twins vs digital phenotyping
- digital twins are typically more concerned about replicating the entire state/behaviour of some physical entity through collecting data and integrating behaviour in real time
- digital phenotyping is focused on collection and analysis of data related to an individuals behaviour, often used in healthcare and psychology, and more concerned with gaining insights rather than replicating an entity per se
- it's more the case that you incorporate digital phenotyping techniques into the development and enhancement of a digital twin
