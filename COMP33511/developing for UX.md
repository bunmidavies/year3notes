- cowboy coding:
	- used by research & development teams i.e. "skunkworks" teams
	- no fixed plan
	- single/pair coders
	- no admin and probably no direct customers
	- outcomes may be uncertain

- agile:
	- individuals and interactions are prioritised over processes and tools
	- working software is prioritised over comprehensive documentation
	- customer collaboration is prioritised over contract negotiation 
	- any necessary changes should be made, rather than only following a fixed plan
