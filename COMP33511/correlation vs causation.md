# causation
- regression analysis is typically used for supporting causation, as it aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (i.e. your interface)
- regression anaylsis is estimating the coefficients of the independent variables to create a regression equation (i.e. a line of best fit between data points, describing the relationship between independent/dependent)
- of course simple linear regression is an option, as well as multiple linear regression, polynomial and logistic
- typically use $R^2$ for determining the 'goodness' and significance of such models
