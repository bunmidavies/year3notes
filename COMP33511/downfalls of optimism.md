- "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later" - Brooks' Law
- computer scientists, developers, software engineers and UX specialists may often be optimistic - this can be a key strength in terms of believing they can code better, create systems that are useful, and fix bugs that they believe they can fix
- however, when planning a project and understanding what aspects can be completed and when, optimism can be a hinderance 
- ==second system effect== - after building a first system carefully, one may often feel buoyed by their expertise and mastery of the first system when building their second - Brooks also described the second system as being the most dangerous one to be building
- for this reason, throwaway projects become much more appealing, as well as thinking of a software project as a family of related products - anticipating enhanced sideways extensions and versioning
- optimism also makes predictions about the work required and how much time will be required - often, predictions can become inaccurate from failing to account for minor delays - "a project becomes one year late, one day at a time"
- ==it is key to understand that your predictions are often optimistic==
