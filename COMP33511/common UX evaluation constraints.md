[[COMP33511]]

- A number of 'commissioning constraints' are identified below, which can be thought of as the types of limitations and real-life constraints a UX specialist may have to deal with when approached by a company for some UX service:
	- ==just-in-time constraint== - the commissioner has approached the UX specialist just in time for user testing to begin, which puts incredible pressure on the UX'er to design and instigate testing
	- ==too-little-time constraint== - the commissioner has approached the UX specialist with not enough time, indicating that user testing is likely to fail or be very rushed
	- ==non-specialist constraint== - parts of the UX process, e.g. user evaluation, being planned very badly by a non-specialist
	- ==inadequate funding constraint== - user evaluation might be well planned, but the resources required has not been accounted for
	- ==pre-supposed outcome constraint== - UX specialists may be coerced or under pressure in some sense from a commissioner to deliver upon some expectations, or in worse cases a desired outcome from evaluation - leading the desire to become more of a requirement itself
	- ==implicit overrun constraint== - user evaluation typically fitting in as the last piece of a linear process often results in any overrunning from other aspects of the process directly harming the evaluation process
	- ==due diligence constraint== 
- in fortunate/rare cases, the ux specialist's work is fully understood and respected by the project planner - this is ==unconstrained development==
