- very often, organisations commissioning UX specialists may not be necessarily in need of some end product or full process, but instead require information - examples of information requirements include:
	- giving the extend and scope of x problem faced
	- come up with some ideas as to a solution or some formal testing of x problem
	- this is a specification, test the software to make sure it fulfils user requirements
	- do some informal testing to allow us to quantify which solutions should be best
	- we feel these problems exist, rigorously test our hypotheses
- these different requirements have different methods of being answered - we categorise different requirements into different methods of ==information elicitation==

### flavour elicitation
- the least resource hungry process - we simply look to understand related work within an area, including standards and best practices
- essentially the commissioner would like a 'flavour' of some thing they're asking for i.e. a specific problem domain
### ideas elicitation
- UX specialist aims to firm up their understanding of the scope and extent of some work/domain at hand
- the commissioner would like ideas for how one could proceed into both a formal development and what problems may exist - ideas and flavour elicitation can somewhat go hand in hand
### informal elicitation
- the commissioner would like to understand if their initial ideas have some traction - essentially performing some stress testing on the fly to determine whether its worth increasing resources and placing more formal study into a domain which will require much more commitment if a task within it is taken up
### formal elicitation
- perhaps undertaken after informal elicitation - at this point it is decided that more resources should be devoted towards uncovering information within a specific domain
- all 3 previous types of information elicitation can be useful for creating some set of hypotheses, to then be tested with conventional methods e.g. surveying techniques and questionnaires, to obtain some statistical context
### laboratory elicitation
- the most resource hungry process - pre-test and post-tests can be involved as this is essentially a mature experiment, with concrete hypotheses involved
- we essentially undertake a true scientific experiment provided we are both pre-testing and post-testing
