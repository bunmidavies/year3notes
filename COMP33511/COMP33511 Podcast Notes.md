# 11 - Efficient Experience (Usability)
- this differs from 'traditional' usability which purely focuses on task completion time, and aims to include aspects such as ==accessibility and learnability==
- created in the early days of HCI with the star user interface - the computer becomes more familiar to people through adopting real world analogies (the desktop, files, folders, trash bin)
- 'dogfooding' - testing and using products by their own developers (xerox star)
- [[usability model]]s - modelling how long tasks should take
- [[potted principles of efficient user experience (SSSADD FLCR)]]

# 12 - Affective Experience (Emotion)
- affective experience and engagement are the 2 of 4 development principles which lean much more to the UX side of HCI, where principles are much more intangible, and 'cutting edge'
- [[affective experience]] + [[levels of emotional response design]]: visceral, behavioural and reflective
- [[visual attention]] - faces provide a source of involuntary visual attraction for humans
- [[affective computing]] - the development of technologies which understand, detect, and ultimately may 'have' human emotions (via GSR, facial expression, etc.)
- [[potted principles of affective experience]]:
	- facilitate quality
	- facilitate aesthetics
	- facilitate flow - the optimality of tasks
	- facilitate pleasantness
	- facilitate satisfaction
	- ==facilitate personality - highest precedence==
- overall, the subjects of emotion are difficult to isolate due to their subjectivity, intangibility, making them difficult to present to people/companies in general

# 13 - Engagement
- the idea of [[group dynamics]] is hugely important for engagement today - adding it when appropriate can provide significant benefits
- [[gamification]] + [[funology]] when appropriate are also beneficial (funology more specifically is 'softening the blow' of lengthy software processes etc)
- bolt-on gamification can be more problematic - some companies will just try to include it when not necessary - also consider ethical implications of gamification
- [[potted principles of engagement]]:
	- facilitate social dynamics
	- facilitate progression
	- facilitate play
- ==consider what it means to gamify your app, and whether it is really appropriate==

# 14 - User Evaluation
- evaluation is very much similar to requirements collection, in the sense that the users become the main source of info once again (we can use a lot of the same techniques)
- the goal is to make sure what has been requested/required is what has been delivered
- [[expert evaluation (walk-throughs + heuristic evaluation)]]
- [[qualitative evaluation methods]] - 'free living settings' are most ecologically valid
- [[quantitative + hybrid methods]] - aim for hybrid methods in most situations, since no one method will collect all the info you need (triangulation = 3 methods)
- think-aloud methods can be useful, but can be biased ('guinea pig effect'?)
- participatory design allows for evaluation throughout the process
- [[3 properties of a good questionnaire]]
- [[common evaluation tools]]
- double and triple blind trials to prevent bias
- pre-testing can compare the deliverable to an already existing implementation certain users might already be familiar with

# 15 - HITL + digital phenotyping
- [[digital phenotyping]] + [[digital phenotypes]] 
- HITL systems really came around during NASA's Apollo mission - a stronger version of [[user centred design]], making users an integral/indivisible part of the process
- another common example is including humans within AI systems
- JCR licklider - man computer symbiosis

# 16 - Evaluation Analysis
- evaluation analysis is essentially the scientific bedrock for determining whether the things we've built fit the user requirements
- typically we have hypotheses ==which must be refutable== - we want YES/NO answers, rather than anything in the middle/ a maybe
- [[variable types + measuring variables]] - things like interval variables may be more trusted than categorical variables, which are more open to interpretation
- data driven approaches can involve altering a hypothesis over time through conducting interviews and finding recurring themes between interviewees
- probabilistic sampling is much less common in UX
- [[UX analysis statistics aside i]] ==is not of huge concern== - we typically care about non-parametric tests since we probably wont have big enough of a sample to represent a normal distribution

# 17 - IRL
- up until now, everything has been described in a 'streamline' like process, where everyone is happy, everything goes as it is supposed to, without a hitch, and resources are as required
- ==this is not how things happen in the real world==
- various [[common UX evaluation constraints]] exist
- methods of [[information elicitation]] - note that laboratory elicitation removes the most confounding variables, but wont give ecologically valid conclusions
- participants, resources (in terms of specialists), and the skills available are all constraints too
- some bits about brooks - ==look a bit more into ?== i.e. throwaway projects (agile esque)
- second system effect
- parallelising your system can be very important in giving everybody something to do

# 18 - Final Thoughts
- overall, UX is still something not fully defined at this point of time
- originally UX mightve been thought as something completely quantitative, but over time has expanded into the qualitative field, with 'romantic' aspects to it
- we've covered
	- how to elicit and model requirements
	- designing the information space, interactions of user experience - ==emphasis is NOT on physical, visual aspects==
	- agile when you know what youre going to build - cowboy coding when you dont
	- various architectures for separating concerns, parallelising tasks
	- design process - potted principles
	- testing + validation (ab testing)
	- the constraints of real life (resources, optimism)
- encyclopedia of human computer interaction is a good resource if you are to carry on
