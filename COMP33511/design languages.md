#### design languages
- design language = a more comprehensive/specific set of design rules, governing the appearance and behaviour of graphics within a user interface - these may typically be CSS stylesheets
- for this reason, design languages typically exist within design systems
- *"A design system is a dynamic dictionary that describes the ever-changing current state of the language, prescribes the proper usage of it, and invites all the users of the language to extend it"* - Marcin Treder, Head of UX @ Google
