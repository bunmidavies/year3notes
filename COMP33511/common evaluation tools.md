- there are many techniques a UX specialist can use for investigating user behaviour, however the 4 most common (mentioned within the pdf) are listed below

# performance measures
- one of the most used techniques for assessing and evaluating user interaction - if a task was completed faster than it had been completed before, the general intuition is that the interface must be better as some sort of enhancement has occured
- common measures for performance include:
	- time required by user to complete task
	- time spent navigating the interface
	- number of incorrect choices / errors popped up
	- number of jobs completed (correctly or incorrectly)
	- number of observations of user frustration
	- frequency of interface components/behaviour that is never used
- inherent biases can exist when the desired outcome is the outcome that performs 'best' - the aim should be to reduce these as much as possible

# eye tracking
- mostly used for usability evaluations, typically 'scanpaths' can be determined through continuous movements of the eye known as 'saccades', where between saccades, the eye remains relatively still for about 200-300ms
- a sequence of saccades provides a scanpath which can be plotted, and the points where the eye is more immobile can indicate points of attention (thus more viewed components)
- if each design is associated with a scanpath/fixation points, feedback can be collected in order to enhance the design

# facial expression
- facial expression provides insights into many implicit cues in user behaviour, which are often difficult to measure via eye tracking or user performance - to detect facial expressions, the user is typically recorded via a standard computer camera, with each task being timed, and according facial expressions are matched to the task being undertaken at the time
- additionally, facial expressions should preferably be confirmed by some disinterested party, such that they are categorised correctly

# biofeedback + affective measures
- quantifiable bodily functinos e.g:
	- blood pressure
	- heart rate
	- skin temperature
	- muscle tension
- can all be recorded for later analysis - within the UX domain however, one of the most often used measures is ==galvanic skin response== - which measures the electrical resistance of the skin, being a good indicator of user stress levels
- heart rate and skin temperature can also be good non-invasive measures of the stress of a participant
- note that there is not a huge amount of scientific evaluation (i.e. backed science) into the applications of biofeedback, indicating its still a slightly immature technique
