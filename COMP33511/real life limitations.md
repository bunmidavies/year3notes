- the 3 biggest are time, participants and resources - further limitations are described afterwards
# time
- time limitation can be subdivided based on the kind of tasks that are required - the amount of writing which is undertaken, the amount of reporting/administrative components, interaction with stakeholders etc.
- time can be trickiest to plan when iterative development/testing is involved - and in most cases, these are critical aspects when empirical work is involved
# participants
- the most intractable limitation of any user facing evaluations
- rewards typically mitigate certain difficulties over obtaining participants
- UX evaluation doesn't typically have the luxury of large sample sizes like social sciences, clinical medicine or epidemiology may have for instance
- for this reason, participant data is also extremely valuable
# resources
- this is a catch-all term for things such as funding arragements, participant reimbursement, travel costs, UXer costs
- this is the maybe the 2nd biggest factor in determining what kind of evaluation work can be accomplished, since in reality it is always possible to figure out how much time is needed and allocate as such, as well as what kind of participants may be needed - but those can only come along with the correct resources at hand

# available skills/expertise
- ==instrumentation== can be seen as useful, but by no means a bar to accomplish good UX work - tools such as cameras and audio equipment, screen recorders, biofeedback tools all make the job easier and provide more data at hand, but also requires the UX'er to be familiar with the device and how such data should be interpreted
- ==collection== is a skill that UX specialists must be well familiarised with, as fully understanding the data collection process and reasons-for-being may not be immediately apparent to anyone
- ==data analysis== skills are one of the key issues surrounding UX work - statistical analysis ([[UX analysis statistics aside i]]) can be an easy tool for inaccuracy, misunderstandings and misinformation - but when used correctly, will be able to provide us with the most information about the UX domain - choosing the right statistics for the job is often the key with many evaluation processes
- experience and expertise for the reasons above must be seriously considered by the evaluation designer, to avoid evaluation from becoming severely flawed
