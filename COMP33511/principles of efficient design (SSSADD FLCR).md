- 10 main principles were collated from a number of usability principles that have been proposed across many different works - the majority of these are more or less intertwined with each other, since by implementing one principle, you may be implicitly improving another principle simultaneously 

#### Consistency

#### Familiarity
- familiarity enhances usability typically through mapping real world concepts to the virtual world / system in question (this is also known as a familiarity via metaphor) - facilitating familiarity allows users to have a sense of intuition around a user interface
#### Interaction Stability
- 
#### Learnability
- users typically prefer to investigate and intuit a system out for themselves, rather than read a user manual - therefore, interface development should have an emphasis on creating a system which aids users in self-learning
- through making system behaviour predictable and facilitating self-learning, ideally users should be able to transit from novice to expert easily
#### Robustness
- robustness is a critical aspect since user trust lies significantly within how often a system crashes as much as how fast a system is - the typical user might prefer a system that is slow but doesn't crash often, in comparison to a system that is fast but crashes frequently
#### Progressive Disclosure
- operations should be arranged in a sort of hierarchy, where you start with simpler options, mitigating certain complexities if you were to provide every single possible option to the user 

#### Scalability
- interfaces should be able to scale, in order to handle larger datasets than envisages - for instance, if you're displaying some text within a certain UI element, you'd need to make sure that for any amount of data, small or large, the size/positioning of the element does not cause visual issues

#### Self-Description
- often implied through other usability principles, the idea of self-description entails the fact that the user should not have to refer to documentation in the vast majority of cases - elements of a user interface can explicitly or implicitly provide familiarity to the user
- in short, self-description implies visually suggesting a path for a user to take based on the interface

#### Simplicity
- building in simplicity treads a fine line, due to the fact that an interface that is too simplistic has its pitfalls as much as an interface that is too complex has - the simplicity of functionality and interaction is as important of a trait as the simplicity of the interface

#### Situational Awareness
- the perception of the interface should facilitate decision making - this means, features such as simple errors, informative feedback, visible components/interactions as well as a singularity of focus, all help to create an environment that users can navigate with accuracy i.e. enhancing situational awareness
