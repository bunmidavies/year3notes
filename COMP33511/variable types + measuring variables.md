- within human sciences, there are many type of variables, but a lot of them can be categorised into 3 main types which concern the UX specialist:
	- behavioural = demographics, or subject variables - for the UXer, this is the user
	- stimulus = independent variable, or input, or cause - for the UXer, this is the interface/computer system
	- observable response = dependent variable, or output - what we are trying to measure 
- the independent variable is what we manipulate - i.e. we manipulate our interface in order to measure the dependent variable

- ==confounding variables== refer to any factors which may affect the internal or external validity of an experiment - in some sense this can be thought of as a type of bias, which UXers should aim to reduce through techniques such as single, double, or triple blind procedures (different levels of user, practitioner carrying out experiment and practitioner analysing results do not know the desired outcome)

# measuring variables
- there are 3 main types of scales to facilitate measurement:
	- nominal scale - denoting identity, no numerical value e.g. gender, occupation - these are also known as categorical variables
	- ordinal scale - denoting identity and magnitude - still categorical in some sense, but the order is significant e.g. fast < very fast < very very fast
	- interval scale - denoting identity and magnitude but has the benefit of equal intervals
- there is also the ratio scale, similar to interval but with the benefit of any two values having a meaningful ratio
- if a scale is distorted such that an observation is no longer accurately reflecting reality, this is called a ==measurement error==
