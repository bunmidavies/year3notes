[[COMP33511]]

- at it's most basic, the scientific method consists of the following:
		1. create a hypothesis that, in the best case, cannot be otherwise interpreted and is refutable ([[scientific bedrock]])
		2. we can amass many observations which keep the hypothesis intact, implying it is correct
		3. one instance of some disagreeing observation must be able to disprove our hypothesis

- in the human sciences, there is often no 100% certainty - all we can have is some level of confidence in a hypothesis, and how some particular test with internal validity, can relate to the general population (thus have external validity)
