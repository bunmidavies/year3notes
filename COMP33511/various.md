As a trained UX’er, you should not be following any particular method by rote, but you should rather understand the strengths and weaknesses of each and select the tools that are most appropriate to your specific requirements within you current design process¹.

### reasons its difficult to know if affective principles have been captured

### considerations for funology / gamification
- not easily quantifiable (yet that doesnt mean we shouldnt try to understand it)
- Yerkes-Dodson Law (performance increases only so much with arousal/pressure)
- "a single cohesive individual vision is required for emotional design based on visceral and reflective outcomes." - the idea that something made for everybody, is truly for nobody

### applying fun/gamifying examples:
- interactive searching i.e. visually browsing through objects on a website instead of just having to type keywords (car sales example: can maybe visually assemble a car on the website)
- create 'learning centre' for the website, with quizzes and walkthroughs potentially rewarding users somehow
- recommendation engines with perhaps personalised messages or avatars
- create a loyalty program or referral system which potentially encourages social and group dynamics as well

### real world examples of gamification
- nike+ - gamified platform integrated with fitness devices, rewarding badges for achievements, creating a small competition element
- starbucks rewards - point-based system based off purchases
- linkedin - profile completion %, quizzes to earn 'linkedin approved' badges (both somewhat serious but realistically still a gamified approach)
- waze - gamifies driving through rewarding points for reporting traffic incidents
