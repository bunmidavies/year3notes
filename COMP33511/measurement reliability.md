- there are 3 main types of reliability that are of concern:
	- interrater reliability - when a judgement by UX specialist is required, multiple specialists perform the same judgement, and the expectation is that these judgements match
	- test-retest reliability - over a continuous period of time, measures of certain variables should be consistent
	- internal consistency - when testing participants, under a variety of conditions should their results be agreeing with each other
