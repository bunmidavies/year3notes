[[COMP33511]]

- these forms of evaluation typically take place before any formal evaluation involving other participants, often conducted by the evaluator themselves or the UX specialist responsible for creating the interface

# walk-throughs
- in all versions of walk-throughs, the evaluator formally addresses each step of the system based on the interaction that is required, and the system components required to enact such interactions
- outputs, inputs and performance are evaluated - thus, the performance of the interface rather than aesthetic or design nature is much more important here
- usability factors like learnability and accessibility can also be gauged here
- the tasks that need to be completed, the actions required for those tasks and the type of users who will be completing such tasks must all be understood by the evaluator

# heuristic evaluation
- heuristic evaluation differs from walk-throughs in the fact that there are specific aspects which must be assessed as the evaluation proceeds
- a set of evaluators are asked to independently answer questions regarding the usability aspects of the interface
- average ratings can be generated for insights before the main evaluation begins
