# Facilitate Social Dynamics
- having a 'community' surrounding your app (especially people who like it)
# Facilitate Progression
- users can see that they are 'levelling up' in some sense while using the app, giving a sense of satisfaction in some cases
# Facilitate Play
- a good balance between challenge and the users skill must be found in order for 'play' to be beneficial
- 'play' that is too easy for experienced users or too difficult for inexperienced players will not give way for good user experience
