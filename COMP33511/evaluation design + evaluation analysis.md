- evaluation design + analysis are two of the most important aspects of preparing to validate the user experience (as mentioned within [[importance of evaluation]])

# design
- as mentioned in earlier sections, for the UX'er, relying on a singular methodology for research is not acceptable - one cannot be assured by the validity of a single research outcome, which is why hybrid approaches are much more prevalent within the field
- quantitative methods provide a broad overview with thin data, while qualitative methods provide a very specific set of data but with richness and depth ([[qualitative evaluation methods]] + [[quantitative + hybrid methods]]), while laboratory methods can provide exact validation but at the cost of no real [[ecological validity]]
- the UXer should design their evaluation methodology to build up evidence through an array of these methods, in order to support development with statistical information in a quantitative fashion, but with deeper understanding that's only found through qualitative work, with some sense of experimental validity + at least the chance of refutation

# analysis
- analysis is important for allowing you to describe the results of your evaluation in an objective way, as well as generalising these results from your set of participants to the general population and supporting any hypotheses
- you need to be able to plan your analysis before it actually happens, since the design of the analysis will inform the way that you design aspects of the data collection i.e. the methodologies you use
#### coding + quantification
- coding is the practice of trying to quantify qualitative aspects of data analysis (e.g. quantifying phrases and sentences) - [[CADQAS]] exists for this reason
- if software to do this doesn't exist, inference and deduction is suitable for the UX specialist, but some additional method of confirmation should be employed - this is typically known as 'in situ analysis'
#### statistics aside
- the majority of UX analysis work uses statistical test to support internal and external validity
- the majority of this is covered in [[UX analysis statistics aside i]]
