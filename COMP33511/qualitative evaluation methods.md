- also described as field evaluation/fieldwork by anthropologists and sociologists - the most used methods on qualitative evaluation are participant observation, interviewing, archival and unobtrusive methods. These are mainly used for building a body of evidence that is deep but narrow in extent/scope

# unobtrusive methods
- a phrase first coined in 1965-66 (Webb, 1966), unobtrusive methods essentially aim to look for traces of current activity in the same manner archival material is used as a past bye-product of regular human activities
- unobtrusiveness is important, as direct experimentation upon participants i.e. directly monitoring their behaviour with their knowledge, can cause unintended changes, skewing findings (bias in a sense) - also known as ==reactive measurement effect==, but a number of effects fit within this category:
	- *guinea pig effect* - people being tested feel like guinea pigs, so behaviour changes
	- *role selection* - people view the experimenter as taking a certain role i.e. having an elevated status, so they follow the experimenters lead
	- *response sets* - people may prefer to agree with a statement rather than disagree if they know people are watching
- to avoid such problems, a technique known as ==simple observation==, where the evaluator simply observes exterior physical signs of people as they're going about their business (conversation sampling is also useful) - can be employed
