- connections lie between fisherian and bayesian inference in the manner in which they take fundamental statistics into account, but their overall philosophies are distinct - note that you can still combine the two approaches if necessary, and some well known approaches do so (e.g. empirical bayes, which borrows concepts from fisherian inference)
- which method you choose will always depend on the problem, as well as what prior knowledge you have (this would prefer to bayes) 
- ==in UX, we currently use fisherian inference i.e. 'statistics' - bayesian inference is often referred to more as a component of 'machine learning'==

- fisherian inference (also known as classical/frequentist inference) heavily relies on sampling from a population, and null hypothesis significance testing, considering the sampling distribution of a statistic under repeated sampling to make inferences about some particular population
- point estimation is used to estimate population parameters - the most common method is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

- meanwhile, bayesian inference takes into account prior knowledge, and aims to update it with observed data to obtain posterior (new/updated) probabilities
- there's a prior probability (i.e. what you currently believe), and a probability is assigned to observed data and its parameters - one can estimate population parameters through bayes' theorem
- instead of acquiring a point estimate like in fisherian inference, you obtain an entire distribution, incorporating prior knowledge and observed data
