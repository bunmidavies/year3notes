- questionnaires/surveys exist to provide statistical descriptions of people and their activities - through asking questions in order to collect information, there are three different properties of a good survey:
	1. probability sampling - by describing the sample of people that response, one can describe the target population
	2. standardised measurement - the answers given should be used in order to accurately describe characteristics of the respondent
	3. special-purpose design 
- questions should always be designed to be good measures, which are reliable and provide valuable/valid answers - avoid inadequate, incomplete or optional wording while ensuring consistent and meaningful responses
- ideally, questions should be evaluated before the survey is given, using techniques like interviews, focus groups, question drafting sessions - participant selection in these cases are also critical
