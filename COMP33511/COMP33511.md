>[!info] Chapter 3 Summary
> UX is a much broader field than UXD, as UXD is predominantly concerned with visual design. Those specialising in UX can be thought of as UX engineers. UXD also covers topics beyond visual design (thus a UX designer does not need to have solely expertise in visual/graphic design), including user research, usability testing, info architecture. Design systems and languages are both designed to provide guidelines and assets to enable a unified design process, but languages typically exists within a system, and the system provides more context/guidelines on how to use said language

# Part IV

> [!example] Chapter 14 (Week 10)

> [!example] Chapter 15 (Week 10)
> - [[human in the loop systems (HITL)]]
> - [[digital phenotyping]]
> 
> > digital phenotyping + HITL are related concepts that can complement each other in a number of ways - digital phenotyping collects and analyses digital data from various sources (typically handheld). Humans with domain knowledge can validate and verify collected data, and provide feedback to improve the quality of data collected within digital phenotyping algorithms. In short, a HITL system enhances the reliability, interpretability and ethical considerations of digital phenotyping algorithms, by involving humans in data collection
