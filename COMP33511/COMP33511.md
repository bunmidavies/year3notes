>[!info] Chapter 3 Summary
> UX is a much broader field than UXD, as UXD is predominantly concerned with visual design. Those specialising in UX can be thought of as UX engineers. UXD also covers topics beyond visual design (thus a UX designer does not need to have solely expertise in visual/graphic design), including user research, usability testing, info architecture. Design systems and languages are both designed to provide guidelines and assets to enable a unified design process, but languages typically exists within a system, and the system provides more context/guidelines on how to use said language
