>[!info] Chapter 3 Summary
> UX is a much broader field than UXD, as UXD is predominantly concerned with visual design. Those specialising in UX can be thought of as UX engineers. UXD also covers topics beyond visual design (thus a UX designer does not need to have solely expertise in visual/graphic design), including user research, usability testing, info architecture. Design systems and languages are both designed to provide guidelines and assets to enable a unified design process, but languages typically exists within a system, and the system provides more context/guidelines on how to use said language

> [!example] Chapter 14 (Week 10)
> - [[expert evaluation (walk-throughs + heuristic evaluation)]]
> - [[qualitative evaluation methods]]
> - [[quantitative + hybrid methods]]
> - [[3 properties of a good questionnaire]]
> - [[common evaluation tools]]
> - [[cons of laboratory-based evaluation]]
> 
> > evaluation methodologies range from very deep qualitative work through to observational empirical work of the experimental/cognitive psychologist. Interdisciplinary aspects of UX based in software evaluation and design also prove useful for evaluation (think walk-throughs + think aloud protocols) - in all cases, ==there is a need for a combinatorial evaluation approach==, which combines quantitative and qualitative approaches, in order to grasp an accurate view of the user - UX is not solely focused on the interface, nor performance - UX evaluation methodologies have practical and scientific outcomes, which enable us to understand more about the behaviour, cognition, and perception of users

> [!example] Chapter 15 (Week 10)
> - [[human in the loop systems (HITL)]]
> - [[digital phenotyping]]
> 
> > digital phenotyping + HITL are related concepts that can complement each other in a number of ways - digital phenotyping collects and analyses digital data from various sources (typically handheld). Humans with domain knowledge can validate and verify collected data, and provide feedback to improve the quality of data collected within digital phenotyping algorithms. In short, a HITL system enhances the reliability, interpretability and ethical considerations of digital phenotyping algorithms, by involving humans in data collection

> [!example] Chapter 16 (Week 10)
> - [[importance of evaluation]]
> - [[inductive reasoning + deductive reasoning]]
> - [[scientific bedrock]]
> - [[the scientific method]]
> - [[variable types + measuring variables]]
> - [[measurement reliability]]
> - [[evaluation design + evaluation analysis]]
> - [[CADQAS]]
> - [[UX analysis statistics aside i]]
> - [[fisherian + bayesian inference]]
> - [[correlation vs causation]]
> 
> > UX requires a firm grasp of the key principles of science, scientific reasoning, the philosophy of science, statistics + statistical methods. No single study will ever guarantee external validity, but we study an array of methods perhaps only proving internal validity statistically, but in the attempt to be able to generalise with some level of confidence, or combine multiple studies - without a well designed method of evaluation and idea of analyses to be carried out, the rest of the UX process is essentially useless, as you will have no real method to validify what you have done

# Part V

> [!example] Chapter 17 (Week 11)
> - [[common UX evaluation constraints]]
> - [[information elicitation]]
> - [[real life limitations]]
> - [[downfalls of optimism]]
> >Many UX textbooks assume perfect conditions for all scenarios within the UX process, and due to UX being an multidisciplinary field, expertise of all such domains is sometimes (for some reason) expected from the UXer - resources required are typically one of the limitations which fail to be accounted for if someone is to plan such processes without expertise. Very often, you'll want to be more pessimistic about a process than optimistic - optimism can lead to bias, lack of both care and understanding at times, and inaccurate predictions. UX professionals must take into account all factors which real-life can impose on textbook evaluation

> [!example] Chapter 18 (Week 11)
> [[a personal philosophy of user experience]]
> *"You may wish to think of UX as the practical application of research knowledge repurposed from other domains into the user-facing software engineering process."*
