- one of the main things to emphasise when producing something of quality within an organisation is whether the best people for the job worked on the interface + its interactions
- quality is not only related to the interface and its design, but also pertains to code quality and the methodologies applied when building a product as a whole
# Aesthetics
- companies like apple value aesthetics a lot - building up a desired image and designing something which one believes the user will perceive as 'beautiful' is the main aim when keeping aesthetics in mind
- functionality does not need to necessarily contrast to functionality, or be a direct tradeoff

- flow is not only about interaction
# Pleasantness

# Satisfaction
