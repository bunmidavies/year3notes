- zero UI = interfaces with little to no user interaction, where users rely less on clicking, typing and tapping, and more on things such as voice recognition or gestures 
- the main goals of zero UI include:
	1. eliminating as much as possible from the users view, creating seamless intuitive experiences
	2. reducing time spent on computers, and having machines understand users in their own natural words and behaviours

- ==conversational interfaces== are a subset of zero UI, where users interact with software in the same manner they interact with other humans - tasks can be completed with more ease when users can give instructions in natural language (e.g. chatGPT)
