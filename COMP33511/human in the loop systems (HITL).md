- Human-in-the-Loop systems combine the interaction and collaboration between human experts/operators and automated systems/algorithms to reach a desired outcome
- in a HITL system, humans are actively involved in various stages of some decision making process, providing input, feedback and guidance to automated systems
	- ==automated system assists humans by performing automated tasks==
	- ==humans provide feedback + guidance to improve automated system==

- this leverages the strength of both humans and machines, as humans offer:
	- domain expertise
	- intuition
	- contextual understanding
- while machines offer:
	- computational power
	- speed + consistency
	- the ability to process vast amounts of data

- HITL systems improve accuracy, efficiency and decision making within various domains e.g. healthcare, customer service, autonomous vehicles, cybersec
- common examples have existed despite the terminology perhaps only becoming more prominent recently - autopilot systems have had pilots intervene when necessary to ensure safety/efficiency of flight operations - NASA also embraces the concept of HITL systems across various aspects of operations

### NASA aside
- HITL systems were instigated - to a large extent - by Margaret Hamilton. A lot of her efforts emphasised the importance of rigorous software engineering practices e.g. error detection, fault tolerance, recovery and prioritisation of critical tasks. She advocated for human-centred approaches for software design, and lead the team that developed onboard flight software for the Apollo missions
- Apollo onboard flight software had the ability to autonomously perform routine/less critical tasks, while also giving astronauts the ability to override automated systems when necessary
- Scientific research and data analysis within NASA also makes use of HITL systems - in short, they're integrated into various aspects of NASA's operations
