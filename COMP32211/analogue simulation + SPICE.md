- in short, SPICE verifies circuit designs at an analogue level, which is more detailed than just at the logic level
- more commonly, SPICE is used to verify/characterise standard cells, producing simplified versions to be used in larger analogue simulation
- the reason for SPICE mainly only verifying standard cells is that a lot of computation is required
- a possible downside is the fact that since this is not performed at the logic level, there's no concept of unknown values i.e. 'X' which can be useful in fault finding
