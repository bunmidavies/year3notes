- with two or more signals, there may be a phase relationship:
	- harmonic frequencies: the phase relationship is fixed - i.e. the frequency need not be the same but the phase of the two signals are always the same
	- non-harmonic frequencies: phase relationship drifgs - i.e. the frequencies could be the same but are out of phase with each other

- a term simply used to describe chips with blocks that run at different clock frequencies, or at the same frequencies but uncertain phases
