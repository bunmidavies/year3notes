[[COMP32211]]

- power domains extend the idea of power gating, by allowing different parts of a SoC to be powered by different voltages

- some of the main issues that may occur include:
	- more supply distribution networks required
	- different signal levels need to cross borders between domains, this is a similar problem to how signals cross boundaries between differently clocked domains
