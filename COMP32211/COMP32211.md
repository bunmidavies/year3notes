# Implementing System-on-Chip Designs

#### Week 1

#### Week 2 - Simulation : [[02.pdf|Slides]]

#### Week 3 - Simulation continued + Verification : [[03.pdf|Slides]] 
- non-blocking assignments always happen after blocking assignments - the values are calculated but held from actually being assigned
- digital simulation is usually 'event-driven' - await events using @

- comparing results:
	- stare at waveforms by hand: useful in initial debugging, but error prone and tedious for regression tests
	- use verilog to compare results against expected set - can import expected results from preprepared file
	- dump trace from simulator and compare offline
- initialisation: it is not predictable what state a certain element will be in when turned on, thus it is ==unknown/undefined== - this can be exploited as a way to indicate whether something is wrong within a circuit
- rule of thumb: control registers should be initialised, meanwhile data registers probably don't need to be initialised (though they can be)

 - functional test examples:
	 - does it reset? i.e. is the initial state achieved, or are there any 'unknowns' created in the circuit?
	 - does it do the most straightforward operations?
	 - have you tested every statement?
	 - is it possible to break the circuit?
 - what to look for in terms of control:
	 - do the interfaces go through expected protocol steps
	 - are fsms behaving as expected?
		 - have all transitions in the state diagram been observed for all reasons that may trigger them?
		 - termination
		 - test coverage
 - what to look for in terms of data:
	 - in an rtl abstraction, the actual details of data are not always considered, but its important to check that the data is correct
	 - data values can be compared with independently generated test results
	 - some data faults can be obvious:
		 - out of range values
		 - wrong number of cycles performed
		 - incorrect graphics drawn (based on values)
- test methods:
	- individual, deliberately targeted tests
	- algorithmically generated (can be useful for checking lines)
	- random patterns i.e. monte carlo
