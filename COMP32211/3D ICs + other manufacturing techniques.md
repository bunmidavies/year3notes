- the first ICs had one layer of metal interconnect, while current chips may have 10+, while the logic is still essentially 2D on the silicon surface
- making truly 3D chips is extremely challenging
- instead, making a stack of 2D chips is more feasible, and saves space when packaging, while also reducing interconnection wire length within the chip

- ==strained silicon== - by straining silicon, the crystal lattice within silicon is distorted, improving carrier mobility thus transconductance - in short, it just makes a transistor 'faster'
- ==copper for interconnect== - traditional on chip wiring is aluminium, however in more recent times copper has superseded aluminium, due to higher conductance (+ stronger than aluminium), though copper is harder to work with, and the process to use it is more complex
- ==finFETs== - a type of 3D transistor, aiming to conduct better while 'on', but also avoid leakage when 'off', but at the cost of more introduced complexity (multigates are a more general term for what the finFET is doing (?))
