- the most typical type of environment variations that a chip may face are classified as ==PVT== - process (how the transistors were manufactured), voltage (i.e. specified supply voltage vs operating supply voltage) and temperature
- as previously mentioned, lower voltage / higher temperatures slow down switching, ultimately slowing down logic outputs

- it is important for chips to work in a variety of conditions, thus physical simulations usually happen over a number of process 'corners' i.e. a number of different conditions including transistor characteristics, manufacturing processes, voltage variations, and temperature ranges
- a target speed should be met at all variations
