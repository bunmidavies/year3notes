- differential signalling is essentially the use of two wires to indicate a logic state - instead of a singular wire representing a 1 or 0, the difference between the two wires being positive or negative can represent a 1 or 0 in the same manner
- differential signalling provides noise immunity - a single wire compared to a ground signal could have had its signal altered, but when using 2 wires, the difference between them should be largely preserved
- this is due to the fact that if a wire encounters some induced noise, if you then had two wires close together, they'd likely each encounter the same noise, so their difference is preserved
