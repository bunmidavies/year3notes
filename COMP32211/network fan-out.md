[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out)

- in electronics, fan-out is the number of gate inputs driven by the output of another single logic gate
- logic gates are typically connected to form more complex circuits - logic gates can't output different signals at any given time, but that single output can be connected to several inputs for other gates
- the ==max-fanout== measures the load-driving capacity of a gate, and the greatest number of inputs it can connect to while still being safely connected

- for bigger fanouts, bigger transistors are required
