- a traditional bus is typically an ==asynchronous bus==, meaning it is timed based off strobes received from its ==master== - the bus has no clock, but essentially has its timing generated by a separate clocked circuit
- in simpler terms, a typical asynchronous bus will have a 'select', 'read', and 'write' signal to determine its operations

- typically, to read using a read_data bus, a select signal becomes active low and the appropriate address to be read from is set - once the chosen address is available, the according read signal will become active low
- once the read data is available, the read signal can be taken high, and the active low select signal also goes high
- writing follows the same pattern, except the data to be written is placed on a write_data bus, and the read_data bus is not involved whatsoever

- other typical approaches can involve an En signal - additionally, a lot of off-chip buses may typically use ==bidirectional buses==, meaning a single bus is used for both reading and writing data
- bidirectional buses are typically used to pin restriction on the package/wiring on the PCB
