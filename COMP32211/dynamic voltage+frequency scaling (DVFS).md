- power dissipation can be reduced/increased by reducing/increasing clock frequency, respectively
- energy dissipation can also be reduced by reducing supply voltage, however this will make logic be evaluated slower

- if there is not much work to do:
	- reduced clock frequency = lower power but same energy/computation
	- reduced supply voltage = lower energy/computation
- if there is a high work demand, supply voltage/clock frequency increasing will improve computation, but increase dissipation
