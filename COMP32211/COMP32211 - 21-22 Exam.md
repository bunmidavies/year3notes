1a) SIMD - same instruction, multiple data - instructions are issued with multiple operands on a singular bus, allowing the instruction to be applied to multiple groups of operands along the bus - tasks such as matrix multiplication which involve a lot of the same operation (i.e. multiplication and addition) can utilise SIMD instructions to have more calculations performed in parallel, increasing speed to complete calculations

1c) power gating is a technique used for parts of a System on Chip which do not require power at a given point, thus typically a pMOS transistor can be placed in between Vdd and the system to control whether the system receives power or not. One disadvantage of power gating is the potential power dissipation introduced by the new transistor which controls whether the system receives power or not

d)
1000x800 32-bit colour pixels required to be displayed each frame = (1000 x 800 x 4) + (1000 x 800 x 4 x 0.25) = 4MB for a frame
4 * 50 = 200
thus 200Mbytes/s needed to maintain the display

e)
i) this is a 'dont care' value, 
ii) uninitialised register, bound to cause more problems/propagate through circuit

f)
increasing the width of a mosfet results in increased drive strength of the transistor, which results in increased edge speed - this can reduce noise around the threshold of the transistor, and reduce power dissipation from spending less time in the 'intermediate' state of the transistor

g) DRC - design rule check is performed to ensure that any layout/physical requirements for fabrication are abided by within after place-and-route has taken place, in order to ensure that fabrication can take place correctly

h) verification tests may typically involve test patterns which follow more of a style as if someone were to be using the chip as it is meant to be used - there may be a focus on providing a 'real world' environment for the chip and providing test patterns such that certain measurements pertaining to timing and physical properties can be verified
post production testing is typically more concerned with covering as many cases as possible to ensure the manufacturing of the chip has not encountered faults - vectors are to be applied to logic deep within sequential machines, and automatic test patterns are typically generated, to try and find manufacturing defects which are not a result of some intuitive 'human' error

i) there is a threshold voltage used within MOSFETs to indicate the point at which a transistor begins to fully conduct current or not
there is another threshold voltage used within CMOS circuits to indicate the point at which a gate will differentiate a digital '0' from a digital '1' - this threshold is more commonly around half the supply voltage

j) APB is most useful in low power electronics which are not hugely fussed about latency - APB transfers simply require a signal indicating whether a read or write is happening, the according address, and write data (if the operation is a write) - with burst operations, an indication of the number of 'beats' or the burst size must be indicated, and the APB specification does not include this type of signal

2a)
synchronous designs when trying to write a RTL or TLM description will be much easier to reason about - in comparison to asynchronous designs, synchronous designs are simplified and 

CAD tools e.g. STA and simulation are optimised for synchronous circuits today, making the 

issues such as clock skew are less prevalent within synchronous designs in comparison to asynchronous designs - designs which may share 1 clock have less issues with abiding by set-up/hold-time constraints


b) clock skew refers to the difference in time between multiple components receiving the same clock signal - it is kept within manageable bounds in a chip design through structures like clock trees, which buffer clock signals to ensure all components receive the clock signal with as little skew as possible

c) balance refers to how evenly spread logic may be across all stages of the pipeline in terms of time required - a perfectly balanced pipeline would require the same amount of time for every stage, meanwhile an unbalanced pipeline would have 'bottleneck' stages of the pipeline

d) assumedly this macrocell cannot be divided up into smaller logic blocks, thus dividing the memory macrocell into multiple stages may not be a viable option 
clock stealing is a common technique employed to essentially take time from a pipeline stage with 'slack' and give it to another pipeline stage which requires it - an appropriate delay can be introduced to the stage after the memory macrocell which requires less time - now, the memory macrocell has extra time to complete its stage, and the stage after will have slightly less time, but provided the introduced delay + critical path of the next stage is <= the clock period, no problems will occur

e)
version A may require slightly more wiring than version B, as well as introducing a new signal for the register while increasing the fan-out of the already existing clock - however, version B may have serious issues with now introducing 2 separate clocks to be used in the same circuit, considering the fact that the register now has an input which assumedly changes once every clock period, and is being sampled once every different clock period - this can lead to the input being sampled at the incorrect time, and every third clock cycle not being correctly captured. Most FPGA implementations will likely have an enable register which can be utilised by the design, so version A would be preferable to version B

f)
ripple counters are relatively simple circuits to implement, with little area overhead which is always beneficial to designers. Additionally, the phase of the clock period should be preserved by the ripple counter, which is beneficial for synchronisation purposes and being able to avoid set-up/hold-time violations

3a)
- Low threshold transistors:
	- require less power
	- may have faster edge speeds?
	- leakage is more common
	- since optimising propagation delay is the task, these may be used more often
- High threshold transistors:
	- less power dissipation due to leakage
	- slower switching speed + potential longer propagation delays
- ultimately, since we've been given the task of optimising propagation delay and whether power dissipation is a concern hasnt been mentioned, lower threshold transistors should be preferred - but it should be noted that such issues as stated above may be prevalent

c)
data is only sent through data_out when the data the stage has is valid (used by setting valid_out high), and the downstream stage is ready (used by checking if ready_out is high) - to receive data, valid data must be ready to be received upstream (used by checking if valid_in is high), and the stage must be ready (through setting ready_in high, upstream to the previous stage) - in a single buffer axi pipeline, this means that the stage must be effectively 'empty' - this implies that at no point can the axi pipeline be more than half full, but it ensures that no data 'crashes' in the pipeline 

d)
bus based communication architectures are heavy in wiring thus resulting in increased overhead and power consumption - simultaneously, the need for increased bus bandwidth with lower power consumption is becoming greater, and with more components contending for a bus, latency may be increased further. AXI already acts like a network with multiple bus channels, and the ability for transactions to be initiated from different units and arrive at different destinations
