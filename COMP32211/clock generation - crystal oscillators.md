- the normal clock source for digital logic is a crystal-controlled oscillator. The vibrations from a carefully machined crystal are used to stabilise an electrical oscillator circuit - without any special care, a frequency within 50ppm (4s error per day) accuracy is usual
- 'quartz clocks' are known to be at least an order of magnitude more precise than mechanical clocks due to the fact that they have crystal oscillators - a much higher accuracy than the 50ppm stated above is achievable with crystal oscillators
- note that for all crystal oscillators:
	- ==no two independent oscillators will run at the exact same frequency==
	- therefore, if a constant phase relationship is required, a single oscillator is required
