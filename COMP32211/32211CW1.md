==inputs==:
- clk
- req
- input data i.e. R0-R7
- de_ack
- de_r_data

- ==lines should be drawn from (R0,R1) to (R2,R3) in colour R6==
- each word is 32 bits, thus each word is 4 pixels
- nbyte is active low, and consists of 4 pixels. i.e. 1011 implies the 2nd pixel in that word is being written to
- de_data is the data being sent to that word - view it as binary for it to make more sense

1. data parameters set up and req is asserted
2. on positive clock edge, 1 clock long pulse should be produced on ack, and busy should be asserted (to be held for the rest of the command execution)
3. de_req  should be asserted the same time as ack
4. de_ack should be asserted 2 clock periods after de_req, in order for a memory cycle to have passed - past this point, outputs can change between now and the next memory cycle
5. 

- lowest nbyte address is the pixel on the FAR LEFT
- i.e. 1110 means the pixel on the FAR LEFT will be drawn to, since that 0 is at the lowest address (i.e. it is the 0th bit)
