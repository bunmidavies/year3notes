- essentially only existing for [[synchronisers]], synchroniser flip-flops aim to resolve metastability quicker than regular flip-flops, by strengthening its internal gain, increasing power consumption
- the synchroniser flip-flop basically has steeper transfer characteristics - as shown on the right, it is typically slower for actual switching, but resolves quickly, thus should only be used for synchronisation purposes
