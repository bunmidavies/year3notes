- pass transistors unlike regular transistors, are not 'explicitly' stacked to an appropriate power supply - the transistor basically works as a switch
- if we look at the regular nMOS/pMOS transistors, either one of them is 'bad' at transmitting one type of signal (as also mentioned within [[MOS]])

- the last inverter is simply used to prevent noise
- a better example is shown in the notes below
