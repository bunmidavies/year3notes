[[COMP32211]]

- it is infeasible to simulate an entire SoC very precisely in one run - instead, multiple simulators can be used for different blocks, such that some precision is lost but in essence now everything has been verified
- different blocks can be verified in different environments with the appropriate amount of accuracy
