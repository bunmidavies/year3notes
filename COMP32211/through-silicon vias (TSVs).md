[[COMP32211]]

- essentially, another 3D interconnection technique, involving components being stacked on top of each other, with holes in between each of them (??)
- using TSVs, a stack of chips can be interconnected:
	- the pros of this are:
		- lots of functionality within a small volume
		- high bandwidth interconnection
		- different manufactured chips can be combined
	- the cons of this are:
		- the approach is still new + expensive
		- heat dissipation
		- supplying sufficient power
