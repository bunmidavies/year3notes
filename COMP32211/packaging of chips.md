[[COMP32211]]

- one of the main constraints of a chip is the number of external contacts it can have
- these can be referred to as 'pads' (contact position on the silicon) or 'pins' (metal contact outside the package)

- traditional chips will have a 'pad ring' around its periphery, where each pad takes up significant space in order to be large enough for a wire/external connection to be attached easily
- smaller chips may be 'pad limited', in the sense that once a pad has been placed and spaced, the central core area has to be reduced in size (?)
