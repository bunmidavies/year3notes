- a CMOS transistor may be regarded as a switch - the threshold of a transistor is the gate voltage where it switches from 'off' to 'on'
- this voltage is measured from the gate to the channel (source or drain), and can be determined when the transistor is manufactured
- different dopant concentrations (i.e. amount of impurities?) allows the construction of various thresholds

- ==transistor threshold is different to gate threshold== - gate threshold is used to differentiate where a logic gate differentiates a '0' from a '1'

- typically, low transistor thresholds allow for faster switching but a wastage of energy, while high transistor thresholds allow for less power consumption but slower times for generating
