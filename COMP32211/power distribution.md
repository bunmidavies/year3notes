- power may be important for 2 main reasons
	1. energy demands on batteries for portable devices
	2. cooling requirements

- with these concerns, 2 main issues are involved:
	1. getting adequate power to where is needed - the current requirements mean there will be a [[supply voltage drop]]
	2. power dissipation i.e. getting waste/heat out from circuits is a genuine issue - CAD tools can help to identify 'hot spots', and high-power demands should preferably be placed near the supply
