- voice loops evolved into essential coordination support tools in space shuttle mission control, but also in other domains
- general aim is cooperative work?
- efforts must be coordinated on a 'moment to moment basis, in response to constantly changing circumstances' - between spatially separate people
- paper essentially explains how voice loops help these activities, and are more or less essential for complex coordinated activity
- maybe potentially talk about learning curves (?)
- front rooms and back rooms, all helping to monitor separate subsystems
- controllers (approx 20 of them supporting flight director) extract telemetry data from the subsystem of their responsibility
- access to subsystem data not of your own usually doesnt happen, but the telemetry displays are available - awareness of surroundings allows for coordination
- coordination is essential since many subsystems are connected (knock on effects etc)
- support staff perform analysis to be given to controllers in front office
- coordination across ==subsystems== = use of voice loops - multiple loops monitored in parallel, rather than a global loop
- controllers monitor a min of 4 loops - main loop = flight director loop, air/ground loop for talking to astronauts (only done by another astronaut controller), front room to back room loop, and ad-hoc 'conference' loop (unused nutil needed)
- ==monitoring multiple loops in parallel is the key to coordination==
- little of conversations feel essentially coherent, but the idea is that experienced personnel dont necessarily 'listen', but moreso monitor
- passive awareness + preattentive reference

- voice aids loop sync through allowing the tracking of the tempo of mission processes
- emphasis on event level information cascading around through voice loops being essential - raw data is not passed, but moreso event level info
- ==there is a lot of focus on cascading information, and how x affects y that affects z==
- how common ground facilitates directed communcation
- synchronous > asynchronous in the case of directed communication
- internal + external cues allow attention to be directed towards whatever
- loops are structured and have specific features/protocols to allow improved attention tracking
- parallel loops = general overview of shuttle parallel to detailed info (front-to-back) - on demand principle
- highly coded language
- different volume levels of different loops
- hierarchy of loops i.e. separation of functionality of loops is another factor which contributes to voice loop success - you only pay attention to loops relevant to your tasks and goals

Up to a certain level of complexity within coordinated activity, the notion of intertwining separate groups into one shared channel of communication may seem counterintuitive. However, in the context of space shuttle operations, though the task as a whole is segmented into particular groups regarding the shuttle, there is a legitimate desire for communication and immediate updates between specific groups where events unfolding within one mission control group cascades across other groups. This idea transcends the specific space shuttle context, as the paper aims to signify - cooperative work in any sort of 'event-driven domain' can benefit from the functionality voice loops provide, one of which is the how broadcasting what Aoki describes as 'highly concurrent information' [1], allows controllers to synchronise their activities efficiently, increasing group productivity.

An interesting distinction the paper raises is the one between 'listening' and 'monitoring' within conversation. As cited from Rochlin, "one discovers that seasoned personnel do not ‘listen’ so much as monitor for deviations" [2] - practitioners who intentionally design interfaces to facilitate monitoring are designing for awareness, and  as Vyas writes "The ways in which cues, traces and indications of work-related activities are ‘displayed’ and ‘monitored’ are central to awareness." [5]. Dourish investigated how shared feedback within a collaborative document editing environment allows for users to work independently yet simultaneously communicate their activities to others, and have the opportunity to monitor and comment on other activity without boundaries, introducing natural collaboration [3]. Heath when discussing the London Underground's Line Control Rooms describes DIAs to 'surreptitiously' monitor Controller messages 'whilst engaged in unrelated and independent action' [4]. 

 to intentionally design for preattentive reference, a type of 'conversational coherence' is not required, which is why the average person listening to any of these will not be able to make much sense of what is truly occuring. User Experience in this context should not be about attempting to cater to everyone
