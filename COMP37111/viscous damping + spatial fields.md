# viscous damping
- viscous damping is used to describe forces which are determined by a particles velocity, and has the following properties:
	- the force opposes the motion of the particle (e.g. travelling through a fluid/wind resistance)
	- energy is removed from the particle, so the system will eventually settle
- too much damping would make motion appear very sluggish, as if in glue

# spatial fields
- spatial fields are an externally specified force within some space applied on particles
- the force on particle i depends only on its position (and in some cases the time)
- arbitrary functions such as:
	- wind
	- attractors, repulsors
	- vortices 
- can all be represented with spatial fields
