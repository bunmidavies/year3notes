- keyframe animation can be defined as a type of animation where animators define key start and end points for an object i.e. ==keyframes==, and a program can interpolate between these keyframes such that the object moves/changes smoothly
- the process that creates the frames in between keyframes can be known as ==tweening== - as said above this gives the illusion of objects moving
