- regardless of the degree of b-spline curve, a minimum of 4 control points are required
- b-spline curves are locally cubic, meaning each segment of the curve is defined by cubic polynomials - chaining these cubics together gives us long and smooth curves
- ==b-spline curves are not anchored to any control points==, which provides more flexibility
- b-spline curves also use bernstein polynomials
