- continuity is a crucial aspect when working with curves, and especially when combining multiple curves

# C0/G0 ?
- the minimum requirement for continuity - it simply means that 2 curves are connected, with no gaps
- ==curves share the same point where they join==

# G1
- the tangents of the two curves at the point they connect are pointing in the same direction
- often sufficient for modelling surfaces and objects

# C1
- the tangents of the two curves at the point they meet must have equal magnitude and direction

# C2
- ensures C1, but also that the derivative of the tangents are the same in magnitude and direction (i.e. the same curvature)

# etc
- continuity goes past C2/G2, continually taking derivatives of the most recent derivative
