[[COMP37111]]

- an explicit form of surfaces, used for creating surfaces that need not necessarily be smooth - by using colours within some texture to represent the height/displacement of that point of a surface, one can easily define surfaces with sharp contours
- the texture can be thought of as a ==displacement map==

- tessellation or a form of subdivision can be applied in order to make the sharp rises of the surface smoother
