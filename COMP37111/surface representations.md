### Explicit Surfaces
- explicit surfaces are typically embodied by a point clouds, a triangle mesh, a [[polygon mesh]] etc.
### Tensor Product Splines
- analogous to curve splines ([[defining curves & splines]]), tensor product splines are essentially parametric surfaces which can use bernstein functions to define points of the surface in 3D
### Implicit Surfaces
- surfaces defined by a single formula
### Procedural Surfaces
-
