- ==interpolation:== constructing a curve such that it precisely passes through all specified points - the points are essentially anchors
- ==approximation:== constructing a curve such that it doesn't necessarily pass through all points, but smoothly approximates the overall shape, and follows a similar trajectory defined by the points without being constrained to all of them

- more flexibility = approximation, preservation + accuracy = interpolation
