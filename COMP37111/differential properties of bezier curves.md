- differential properties of curves can be useful for various reasons
- the 1st differential of a curve's point is the tangent - for a parametric curve this is given as:
  $$T(t) = \frac{P'(t)}{||P'(t)||}$$
  (normalised)

- curvature/acceleration is the 2nd differential of a curve's point, using the already calculated $T$
$$N(t) = \frac{T'(t)}{||T'(t)||}$$
