# Advanced Computer Graphics

computer graphics can be split into 3 main steps:
1. modelling
2. animation
3. rendering
each number represents the corresponding week in which the workshop for that content was covered
#### 1. curves
- [[polylines]]
- [[defining curves & splines]]
- [[interpolation & approximation]]
- [[bezier curves]]
- [[continuity]]

#### 2. surfaces
- [[surface representations]]
- [[polygon mesh]]

#### 3. colours + intro to animation
- [[keyframe animation]]

#### 4. animation principles 2 + physics-based animation
- [[rigging and skinning]]
- [[forward kinematics and reverse kinematics]]
- [[euler method]]

#### 5. simulation + collisions
