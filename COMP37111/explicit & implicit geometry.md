- geometry can generally be represented in two ways:
	- explicit: examples include point clouds, polygon meshes, NURBS (non-uniform rational basis spline) - easy to work with and provide precise control of shapes
	- implicit: level sets, algebraic surfaces - more useful in scenarios where simplicity and efficiency are of most value
