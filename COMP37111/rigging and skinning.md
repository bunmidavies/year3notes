- ==rigging== = building 3D models by using hierarchical bone structures, where different bones/joints move in part with each other 
- ==skinning== = associating a characters geometry/mesh with bones and deforming the geometry accordingly, based on how the bones move
- by using skinning, an animator does not have to focus on moving every single vertex within a polygonal mesh, but instead can just move bones how they want
