[Squash and stretch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_and_stretch)

- two basic, but key terms in animation:
	- squash - to flatten an object or character by some external pressure or its own power. Objects on impact are typically 'squashed'
	- stretch - to lengthen/extend an object 
- the terms are key as these two principles are what gives elasticity and flexibility to animations, and communicates an objects material within animation
