- particle based systems can be used for fluid simulation - these particles interact with each other, and when it comes to rendering, the particles are wrapped around in a mesh to give the fluid an actual 'fluid' look, rather than just being a bunch of big particles

- lagrangian simulation applies attributes to all individual fluid particles 
- eulerian simulation takes a grid-based approach, dividing the entire simulation space into a number of cells 

- hybrid fluid simulation combines both lagrangian and eulerian simulation
