# corner cutting
- corner cutting is a common way to subdivide surfaces, smoothing them out (many techniques exist)
- the original surface can be thought of as a ==control polygon==, with control points

# chaikin's algorithm
- chaikin's algorithm is another subdivision technique, which is able to smoothen out polyline curves into quadratic b-spline curves
