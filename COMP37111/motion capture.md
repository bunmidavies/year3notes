- motion capture is a data-driven approach to creating animation sequences - real world performances are recorded, and poses are extracted as a function of time based off the raw recorded data
- typically, optical markers and multiple high speed cameras are used in order to capture raw data based off movement, rather than just film footage
- to get the markers 3D position, a triangulation process can be used - however, this process is obviously costly and somebody does have to be recorded for this to be possible
- the 3D markers do not directly map to the controls of some bones within a 3D model, so the process of converting markers into character controls is known as ==retargeting==
