[[COMP37111]]

- in short, color spaces are organisations of colours such that colours can be reproduced with specific values, and typically calculations are provided in order to convert to/from colour spaces

- the most popular color space is ==CIE XYZ== - to originally determine this color space, only the R, G and B values must be determined, then by linearity, the rest of the spectrum can be represented
- a reference light was displayed against a test light - the reference light was built from the addition of the proposed R, G and B values - these values were tweaked until the difference between the reference light and test light were undifferentiable to an observer
