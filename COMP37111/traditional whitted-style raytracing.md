- Turner Whitted in 1979 described a practical, recursive algorithm for basic Ray Tracing - raytracing essentially reverses the process of how nature works, thinking of rays as originating at the eye point, then moving through the environment until they reach a light source or leave the scene without touching a light
	1. fire a primary ray from the eye point, through the viewplane, into the scene - if the ray flies through the scene without hitting any surfaces, it's lost and doesn't contribute to the final image
	2. otherwise, at the point the ray interacts with a surface, check if any light could have hit any of the environments light sources - you do this by sending out shadow feelers to each and every light source - if the shadow feeler can reach a light source without being interrupted by some other object, there is direct illumination, otherwise the point is in a shadow caused by the blocking object
	3. if the surface the ray hits is transparent, a refraction ray must be created, taking into account any change in angle, colour, or intensity - then, recursively follow the path of this ray following the same steps stated, but remember where it originated from so it can contribute to the original ray
	4. if the surface is reflective, a reflection ray must be made, that bounces as needed, and traced recursively
	5. once a ray reaches a light source, runs out of 'energy' or exits the scene, the process for that ray stops, and the effect on the originating ray/viewpoint is calculated, resulted in a pixel being plotted
	6. repeat for every pixel on the viewplane, or repeat multiple times for each pixel and blend results together for better results

- since a ton of rays are already generated by this traditional style using only 1 ray per reflected surface, diffuse reflection becomes incredibly computationally heavy, thus giving our first limitation of ray tracing - ==all surfaces are essentially specular==
- ray tracing naturally reproduces several important visual effects including
	- umbra shadows
	- reflections
	- refraction
	- participating media e.g. fog, smoke
- through addition to the algorithm, 'camera effects' e.g. depth of field/shape+aperture of lens can be included
- however, as we've said ray tracing can't model diffuse reflection very well, it means things like soft lighting + soft shadows (e.g. penumbra shadows) can't be modelled well by default
- however, through firing more rays at 'areas of interest' i.e. places you think diffuse reflection could occur, a slightly better result can be obtained, though still a workaround and not traditional
- ray tracing's high computational complexity (dependent on both image space and scene space) makes it somewhat unsuitable for various purposes:
	- big scenes in an open space (rays will travel for a while before they make it out?)
	- interactive apps (as ray tracing is viewpoint independent)
