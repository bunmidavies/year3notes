- light is one type of EM wave, with a spectrum sitting between ~450nm to 700nm

- the light and colour of some object that we see is influenced by a number of factors, but is mainly a result of the illuminance of the incident ray of light hitting the object, multiplied by the reflectance of that object for that specific wavelength
$$I_{\textrm{reflected}} = I_{\textrm{incident}} \times \textrm{Reflectance}$$

# terminology

- the lectures have defined these terms in relation to a wavelength/relative energy graph
- intensity - measured in candela per metre$^2$, intensity measures the area underneath the graph
- hue - the predominant wavelength defining some colour, i.e. the mean of the wavelength/relative energy graph
- saturation / chroma - the amount of achromatic light (white light), i.e. the variance of the mean within the wavelength/relative energy graph
- intensity, hue and chroma are all interrelated, and ==cannot be changed independently==
