- there are two main forms to represent games:
	- ==normal form== - a table containing all possible strategies for a player against all possible strategies for the other player, with each cell containing the according payoff
	- ==extensive form== - the regular tree form of games
- with realistic sized games, its more common to work with game trees - meanwhile much smaller games/theoretical purposes can be applicable to normal form
- a tree can be searched much easier than a list, and normal form tends to end up including a lot of redundant/'non-existent' paths, leading it to be less computationally efficient
