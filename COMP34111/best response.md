- we assume that we are player 1 and that there are players 2 to $l$
- we also assume each other player has a specific strategy, i.e. $s_2...s_l$
- all possible player 1 strategies are grouped as $s_1$
- the ==best response== is the strategy or strategies $s^*_1$ where:
$$p_1(s^*_1,s_2,...,s_l) \geq p_1(s_1,s_2,...,s_l)$$
- meaning that $s^*_1$ gives the ==maximum pay-off==
- it is possible to calculate the best response to a given choice of strategies for other players, but of course this assumes that one knows what all the other players will do
- most games do not have strategies that are the best responses to all possible strategy choices for other players

- if a player has a ==winning strategy== in a 2-person zero-sum game with payoffs $\{-1,0,1\}$, then it is a best response to all the other player's strategies

### no best response
- in infinite game spaces, it may not be possible to find a best response
- e.g. two players, $X_1$ picks a number then $X_2$ picks a number - whoever has the greater number wins
