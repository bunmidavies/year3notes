[[COMP34111]]

- there are specific situations in which learning is preferred to minimax:
	- good heuristics cannot be found
	- branching factor is very high
	- equilibria being hard to compute (games of incomplete info, general sum games, games with many players) 

- ==common example: Go==: the branching factor is high (played on a 19x19 board), it has a deep game tree, and lacks any known reliable heuristic value function for non terminal board positions
