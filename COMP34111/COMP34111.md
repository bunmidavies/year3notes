[[AndreasNotesWithPrefaceNLinks.pdf|Lecture Notes in Game Theory (Andrea)]]

#### Week 1 - Live Lecture 1
- [[intuition of games]]
#### Week 1 - Live Lecture 2 : [[AStarLecture2023HO.pdf|Slides]]
- A* Search: it exists, why it can be preferable to Dijkstra's, and choice of heuristics
- heuristics, and the [[properties of a good heuristic]]
#### Week 2 - [[COMP34111examples1|Problem set]]

#### Week 2 - Live Lecture 1 : [[GamesL1pages2023-24OpeningHO.pdf|Slides]]
- Defining what a game is ([[intuition of games]]) 
- drawing game tree for Nim-3
- handling chance through additional player, "Nature"/"Chance"
- games with imperfect information - information sets (tiny poker example)
- complete/perfect information = each node is its own information set
- zero-sum games, games with/without chance

#### Week 2 - Live Lecture 2 : [[GamesL2_2020(1).pdf|Slides]]
- [[representing games]]
- normal form is mathematically convenient, but can result in redundant paths (therefore computationally inefficient)
- [[solved game theorem]]
- [[levels of game solutions]]

#### Week 3 - Live Lecture 3 : [[GamesL3_2023.pdf|Slides]]
- [[best response]]
- [[nash equilibrium point]]

#### Week 3 - Live Lecture 4 : [[GamesL4_2023_4HO.pdf|Slides]]
- [[mixed strategies]] 
- [[expected payoff]]
- [[mixed strategy equilibria]]
