ultra-weak: there exists a player who can force a win/draw - no strategy exists in the solution (non-constructive proof)  
  
weak: solution provides a strategy whereby one player can win or draw **starting at the beginning of the game**   
  
strong: solution provides a strategy which produces perfect play (optimal) from any point of the game, even if mistakes have been made prior (but this doesnt mean a win is guaranteed since you couldve made too many mistakes)
