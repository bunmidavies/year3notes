[[COMP34111]]

- games can take a variety of forms, but typically all share some common properties:
	- a number of ==agents== (players) interact with each other, and at the end of these interactions, each player receives a ==payoff== (some numerical outcome)
	- this payoff may be negative or positive
	- the decisions an agent can make are well defined at any point
	- the final outcome is uniquely determined
	- it is assumed that each player aims to maximize their score without regard for other players (==rational behaviour==), and the value associated with different outcomes reflects the worth of that outcome to all players
- games are relatively successful at modelling many situations in the real world, since the above are quite broad requirements - describing the situation with equations isn't required, and instead you can just describe rules, and the potential outcomes with their measured payoffs

- in COMP34111, we are only concerned with ==non-cooperative== games, where players cannot pool their pay-off and cooperate in affecting the outcome
