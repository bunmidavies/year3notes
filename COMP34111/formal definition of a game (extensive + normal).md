- normal form - each player chooses one strategy at the start - they each play according to that strategy, and the payoff is simply represented within a table
- using fully specified strategies will simply make the table larger
- if a game is given via its strategies and a pay-off table for each player, we say the game is in ==normal form==, i.e. ==matrix form/strategic form==
