- Monte Carlo methods encompass a broad class of computational algorithms, typically relying on repeated random sampling, and using such randomness to find answers which may be deterministic in principle

- Monte Carlo methods typically follow a particular pattern:
1. define a domain of possible inputs
2. generate inputs randomly from a probability distribution over the domain
3. perform a deterministic computation on the inputs
4. aggregate the results
