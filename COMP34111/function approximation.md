- typically, q-learning/v-learning requires visiting a large number of states/state-action pairs requires everything to be visited a bunch of times in order to gain a good estimate - furthermore, a huge table needs to be maintained, and both of these have significant impacts on performance
- function approximation is the attempt at using supervised learning to approximate a Q/V function
