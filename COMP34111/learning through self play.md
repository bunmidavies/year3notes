- a typical example of self play involves two independent learning agents playing games against each other - agents will typically begin from a naive/no knowledge state, and incrementally improve through each playthrough of a game
- self-play has been used in [[AlphaGo]] Zero/AlphaZero, and a simpler type of self-play is used in [[MCTS - monte carlo tree search]] to reach an end state where a reward can be backpropagated

self-play has been made comparable to 'tabula rasa', which in epistemology is the idea of individuals being born empty of any built-in mental content, thus all knowledge comes from later perceptions/experiences - mental content/knowledge in this sense differs to the basic reflexes/hardwired biological components of a human, since you could argue that a baby from birth 'knows' how to breathe, cry and scream
